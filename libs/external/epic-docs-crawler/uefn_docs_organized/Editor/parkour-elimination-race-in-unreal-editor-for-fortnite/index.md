In **Parkour Elimination Race**, players must finish a challenging parkour race, then get teleported to a free-for-all elimination arena to battle it out. The winner of the race gets to be the first to purchase a weapon to use during the elimination phase of the game.

Their arrival in the elimination arena sets off a 30-second timer. The rest of the players must finish the race in this time! After 30 seconds, everyone who has not completed the race is teleported to the arena and must rush to buy a weapon to defend themselves.

The first player to get 10 eliminations wins the game.
