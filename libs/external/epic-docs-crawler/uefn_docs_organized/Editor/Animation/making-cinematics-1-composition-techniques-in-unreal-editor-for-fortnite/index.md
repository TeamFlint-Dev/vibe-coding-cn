After creating a level sequence and opening the [Sequencer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#sequencer), adding a camera [actor](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#actor) to the scene opens a small window in the [viewport](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#viewport) that acts as the camera's viewfinder. Inside Sequencer you can open more camera settings and make adjustments to the camera.

The composition of a cinematic refers to the camera angles and shots, [character](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#character) movement and placement, foreground and background elements and more. Depth of field plays an important role in composition, this refers to where the subject is in the camera's lens. The most common composition techniques include:

- **Rule of Thirds**
- **Leading Lines**
- **Camera Angle**

## Rule of Thirds

The rule of thirds is a guideline that refers to how visual images are framed for films, paintings, and photographs. The guideline suggests that an image should be divided into nine imaginary, equal parts by two equally spaced horizontal lines and two equally spaced vertical lines. Important compositional elements, such as characters or props, should be placed along these lines or their intersections.

## Leading Lines

Leading lines create a visual pathway that points players to the essential subject of the camera. These invisible lines can be strengthened by facing [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#prop), NPCs, and environmental assets to literally point toward the subject and lead the player’s eye to the subject.

In the image below, Character devices were placed pointing toward the theater box office. The shape of the theater itself draws your eyes first toward the sign, then down toward the box office.

## Camera Angle

Camera angles use the X-axis to frame characters and view the world. There are numerous camera angle types that can be used to create artful cinematics. The image below illustrates the different axes in a camera’s shot. The X-axis is from side-to-side in the shot, the Y-axis is the foreground and background, and the Z-axis is from the top and bottom of the shot.

The examples below use Fortnite lobby images as examples of the different camera angles.

### High Angle

High angles are used to capture the subject from above, looking down on the subject. Usually, a high angle uses a [tight shot](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-cinematics-3-camera-movement-and-framing-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to frame the subject. Notice how the subject of the image below looks up toward the camera.

### Low Angle

Low angles capture the subject with the camera from a low angle, looking up at the subject for a dramatic shot. This can make the subject in the frame appear taller, heroic, and depending on lighting and color, even evil.

### Dutch Angle

Dutch angles capture the subject on an angle so that the subject is rotated in the frame. A dutch angle can be used for a dream sequence or to create the feeling of not being in control.

### Overhead

Overhead angles capture the subject from above, but unlike a high angle, there can be more or less of the subject in the frame. In the image below, an overhead angle is used to impress the feeling of height as the subject climbs higher.

### Ground Level

Ground level angles capture a subject from the ground. A camera is usually placed on the ground and faced forward toward the subject. This sort of angle creates a distorted view of the subject and terrain.

For a real cinematic feel, a player or character can even walk over the camera using the ground level angle to create an impressive cinematic effect.
