Welcome to the **LEGO® Music Concert island**, where players can learn about about the [Fortnite Patchwork music system](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/composing-with-patchwork-in-fortnite-creative) in a desert playground. Players can experiment with the devices and even make their own music!

The LEGO templates are slightly different from Fortnite Creative islands: some devices are not available to use, and some settings are hidden. To learn more, see [Working with LEGO® Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-lego-islands-in-fortnite-creative).

## Playing Music Concert

In **Play** mode, players visit a desert festival campground where cute LEGO animal friends invite them to play with Patchwork devices. A DJ and a band are set up on different stages, and players can edit the devices to change the music. This section will give you a basic walkthrough of the game, explaining which devices are used and why.

The basic flow of the game moves the player from one area to the next using beacons. Each area features a different animal character and a different Patchwork device.

### Beacon 1: Welcome

To start the game, open the **Sidebar** and click the **Start Game** button. You start in front of the entrance to the festival grounds. To the left of the entrance, there's a vulture (not as scary as it sounds — it's a nice vulture!) with a **1** beacon over his head. Walk toward the bird.

You can see that the **Beacon** device is used here to guide the player through a [golden path](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#golden-path). This is useful when you are learning something step by step or layer by layer. The player is free to explore, but the beacons provide structure and let them know what they should do next when they're ready to move forward.

[![Vulture Dialog - Welcome](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/24a19ebf-8856-46ef-9d6d-dc7fdb56bcd6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/24a19ebf-8856-46ef-9d6d-dc7fdb56bcd6?resizing_type=fit)

When you get closer to the bird, a box pops up that says "Welcome to the Music Concert! Follow the numbers around the festival to learn how to make music." You can also see an objective box in the upper left corner of your screen, which counts how many areas of the game you have visited. This is produced by the **Tracker** device, and you can use this device to create and track all kinds of quests or missions.

The **Popup Dialog** device provides player information as well as some dialog for narrative flavor. Once you close a dialog box, you can see beacon **2**. Beacon 2 leads you to the DJ stage, inside the festival grounds.

### Beacon 2: DJ Llama

As you move toward beacon 2, you start to hear a drum beat. As you get closer, the drum beat gets louder. When you get close to the beacon, a box pops up for DJ Llama, who says "Oh hello! Let's make some beats together!" The animal characters are used to attract the player's attention and provide more visual novelty than simple signs do on their own.

[![DJ Llama Dialog](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9b270f9b-02ff-4c54-909f-6e9523e6c72e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9b270f9b-02ff-4c54-909f-6e9523e6c72e?resizing_type=fit)

Behind DJ Llama, on the left side of the stage you'll see a sign. It says "Equip the Patchwork Tool! Now try changing the drums by adding new shapes to the grid in the D-SEQR (Drum Sequencer)." The sign is a combination of a blank sign prop and the **Billboard** device. Billboards are used here to give players more instructions and hints.

[![DJ Llama's Sign](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7ceca8f3-c47a-4738-85ea-667b1218e43e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7ceca8f3-c47a-4738-85ea-667b1218e43e?resizing_type=fit)

Walk over to the **Drum Sequencer**, which is to the right of the sign. Equip the Patchwork Tool if it isn't already in your hand, by opening the **Player Menu** and selecting the Patchwork Tool. Point the Patchwork Tool at the Drum Sequencer, and you can see different areas of the device highlighted as you move the Patchwork tool around.

To add sounds to the current drum track, first you should choose a shape (to the right of the grid). Each shape represents a different drum (or other rhythm sound), and you can add or subtract these shapes to change the beat. Below the grid, you can toggle the **Preset** switch and then choose one of the preset beats by clicking the arrows. You can customize a preset by editing the shapes on the grid.

### Beacon 3: Piano Rabbit

Once you are done with the Drum Sequencer, turn to your right and you should see beacon **3**. You can see some tents in the distance, and as you move toward the beacon you hear a melody playing. You then see the Piano Rabbit and another sign. As you get closer to the beacon a box pops up for Piano Rabbit, who says "Hey hey hey! Give me a hand (or a foot!) making a colorful melody to match my rainbow!"

[![Piano Rabbit's Dialog](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/caa5e25e-0110-4639-8907-0350e1bab5a1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/caa5e25e-0110-4639-8907-0350e1bab5a1?resizing_type=fit)

This sign says "Now try using the Patchwork Tool to change the notes on the N-SEQ (Note Sequencer). Change the step rate and listen to how the music changes!"

[![Piano Rabbit's Sign](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/47cec8eb-df80-4df1-864f-b54312d08e1d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/47cec8eb-df80-4df1-864f-b54312d08e1d?resizing_type=fit)

To the left and behind Piano Rabbit, you'll see the **Note Sequencer** device. This is where you compose a melody. Like the Drum Sequencer, the Note Sequencer has a grid. But on the left side of the grid you'll see the names of different notes.

For this device, clicking a grid square on a line adds the corresponding note to the melody. You can choose more than one note in each column, so you can create chords as well. The number of columns is set by **Length** knob. If you want to change the **Step Rate**, a setting to the lower left below the grid, it changes how fast the sequencer moves through the notes.

### Main Stage

Move through the rainbow arches (passing a number of other Patchwork devices), and when you get through them all you should see beacon **4** displayed. It's on the other side of the festival grounds. As you move toward it, you'll go past the **Main Stage**, with musicians playing their own song. In front of the stage are switches marked **Drum**, **Bass**, **Melody**, and **Chords**. Here the **Switch** device is used to turn each section of the song on or off. This shows you how the song sounds with and without the various parts.

The switches mentioned above are only enabled during Play mode. They are disabled when you are editing your island.

### Beacon 4: Organ Frog

Continue toward Beacon 4 and you'll hear a bass line playing. Approach the beacon and a box pops up for Organ Frog, which says "Hello Friend. This is my Jam Cave. Can you help me sound more like an organ?"

[![Organ Frog's Dialog](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bec36d4b-8d88-4e34-a84e-823f512c69ff?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bec36d4b-8d88-4e34-a84e-823f512c69ff?resizing_type=fit)

You'll see another sign next to Organ Frog. The sign says "Use the Patchwork Tool on the I-PLY (Instrument Player) to change the arrows, then move the Volume knob to see what happens!"

The arrows referred to in the sign are the arrows under **Instrument** on the device. Clicking the arrows changes the instrument that is playing the bass line, and you can flip through them until you find the **Organ** setting.

[![Instrument Player Changing Instrument](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/668f2bbb-ec08-4f46-a549-b22a111f63e2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/668f2bbb-ec08-4f46-a549-b22a111f63e2?resizing_type=fit)

### Beacon 5: Vibe Turtle

Now turn completely around and you will see beacon **5**. When you get to the beacon, a box pops up for Vibe Turtle, saying "Ahoy! To keep things chill, let's add some echo-echo-echo to my vibraphone-phone-phone!"

[![Vibe Turtle's Dialog](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a7fb38f8-5de8-4fd4-ad6c-bd999c324abe?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a7fb38f8-5de8-4fd4-ad6c-bd999c324abe?resizing_type=fit)

The sign says "Use your tool on FX-ECHO – play with the Mix and Feedback knobs to hear how the notes repeat and echo. So cool!" You can aim the Patchwork Tool at the **Filter**, **Mix** and **Feedback** knobs on the Echo device to modify the sound of the vibraphone.

[![Organ Frog's Sign](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c34de39a-def3-420b-8fed-bb09ad847e07?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c34de39a-def3-420b-8fed-bb09ad847e07?resizing_type=fit)

### Beacon 6: Behind the Scenes

Turn back towards the Main Stage and you'll see beacon **6** displayed. This leads you to a cave where the Patchwork devices for the Main Stage are located. There are also other devices there, with signs giving you some basic information about how the device is used. This is the last area in the game. To go back to editing your island, open the Sidebar and click the red **End Game** button.

## Customizing Your Music Concert Island

Now that you have played through the initial gameflow of the Music Concert, you can go back and customize it, or use the devices and assets on the island to create your own musical game.

### Add More Fortnite Patchwork Devices

The original setup of this island is pretty simple. It's designed to teach only the basics. But the Patchwork system has a lot of different devices, and you can use any of them (or all of them!) in your own creation. Here is a list of some ways you can expand on the basic gameplay of Music Concert just by adding more Patchwork devices:

- [Add more of the Patchwork devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-patchwork-devices-in-fortnite-creative), and lead players through the composition of a larger or more complex musical piece.
- Create a Jam Stage (like in Fortnite Festival!) where players can experiment with making music together.

### Add More Creative Devices

Although you can't use [all the devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite) in the Creative toolset, there are almost 100 devices that are approved for you to use on your LEGO Island. You can add devices to enhance the existing gameplay, or even completely change it!

For example, there is already a Tracker device set up to track how many of the music areas the player has visited. You could add an Accolades device and connect it to the Tracker, so that when the player has visited all areas they gain XP.

Here are some other ideas for gameplay mechanics you can add by using Creative devices:

- Add [Prop Mover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prop-mover-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices (along with the Patchwork [Note Trigger](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-patchwork-note-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device) to create objects that move to the music. You can create a platforming component to the music learning path! Want to learn more? Check out this defunct disco where we show you how to build this experience in [Syncing Music and Gameplay Using Fortnite Patchwork](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne5TKWYi25M).
- The music on the island is already set up to have positional audio—that means as you move around, the sound will come from the direction of its location. It also means as you move farther away, the music gets quieter and will eventually stop entirely once you are far enough away. You could use this feature to create a Hide and Seek aspect to the original game path. Or you could hide the performers that are currently on the main stage, and use another Tracker device for finding the animals and placing them on the stage.
- You could create an area on the festival grounds for mini-games, and add another Beacon device to lead players there after they have completed the main learning path. Think about carnival games, or other games that include music, and find the [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-asset-inventory-in-fortnite-creative#devices) you need to make those mini-games happen!

## On Your Own

Now that you've learned the basic ideas of creating your own LEGO music concert, get out there and get jamming! You can use this island as a foundation to build games that incorporate music as a central game mechanic, or to create a unique soundtrack for your other game modes.
