Squid Game features games that often have harrowing consequences. The Squid Game feature set with Fortnite provides the opportunity to recreate your own childhood games with a twist. The design team focused on mechanics and common actions players can perform that are featured in many playground games.

The template has multiple rooms, where you can experience each mini-game. Become familiar with scoring points, surviving as long as you can, and multiplayer setups. Mini-games are a great way to keep your experience going with opportunities for multiple players to be winners.

Use the template to gain a better understanding of how mini-games fit the brand, and create gameplay that resonates with players who are fans of the show. You can use this guide as a companion to the template to dive deeper into the following:

- Mini-game concepts
- Settings for devices
- Incorporating Squid Game assets

What games do you remember playing as a child? Hide and seek? Hopskotch? Tag?

How would you play on subverting the innocence of these nostalgic games into something appropriate for Squid Game? Something that’s easy to learn to play but has high stakes.

| Room | Gameplay |
| --- | --- |
| **Progress Based Mesh Device** | Learn to swap meshes to create a visual representation of progress with the Progress Based Mesh device. And watch for surprises. |
| **Shove Item** | Be quick, the first person to press the button wins but the platform shrinks and others are eager to push you off with the Shove item. |
| **Ddakji and Flying Stone Items** | Aim for the targets with Squid Game throwable items and watch your Llama Bank fill up. |
| **Carryable Spawner Device** | Carry objects through obstacles, but be careful as the VIP members are determined to eliminate you. |
| **Skilled Interaction Device (Multiplayer)** | Don't fall into the lava. Work as a team to pass the multiplayer skill checks and avoid elimination through lava.  Includes a Verse example in the Verse level asset. |

The loading room is set up with multiple spawners and best experienced with multiplayer. You can use [multiplayer previewing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/multiplayer-previewing-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to help test out some of the rooms.

Each room uses assets from the theme galleries to capture the aesthetics of Squid Game. Keep the design elements in mind as you explore ideas for your Squid Game island. To learn more about these galleries, see [Working With Squid Game Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-squid-game-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
