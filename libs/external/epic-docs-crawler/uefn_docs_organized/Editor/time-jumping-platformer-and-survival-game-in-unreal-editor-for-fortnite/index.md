Jumping between day and night during gameplay not only adds visual interest to the island, it can also offer new experiences and gameplay to players without their having to reach another level first. Time jumping can be impactful for many game genres.

The example project in this tutorial is a platformer during the day, and a survival game during the night. A number of gameplay mechanics are used to create the time-jumping effect and add danger to the nighttime gameplay. The island is customized further with unique landscapes, [user interface (UI)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#ui), and music.

The art direction in this project is a cosmic horror landscape coupled with a sense of urgency in the music.

The following Nature Galleries were used to create the look.
