1. A  self-contained tile for rendering a piece of terrain. Sometimes components are called [cells](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#cell). Also see [World Partition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#worldpartition).
2. Components are what provide data and behavior to the [entities](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#entity) in [Scene Graph](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#scenegraph). Components define what an entity is supposed to be doing in the scene.

Components have editable properties that can be physical, like a static mesh and particle system, or logical, like a gameplay tag or custom Verse code that defines the movement of a platform. By default, all entities have a transform component to specify where the entity exists in the world.

In Verse, a function or group of related functions in a program that can be reused.
