| [`fort_playspace`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/playspaces/fort_playspace) | A nested container that scopes objects, style, gameplay rules, visuals, etc. All objects and players in an experience will belong to a fort\_playspace. There is typically one `fort_playspace` for an entire experience, though this may change in the future as the platform evolves.  To access the `fort_playspace` for a `creative_device` use `creative_device.GetPlayspace`. |
