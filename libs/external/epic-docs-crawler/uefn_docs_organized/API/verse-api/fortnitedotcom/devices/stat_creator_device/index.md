A device that generates a scoreboard stat that can be used by the game to determine Game End and Round End conditions.
The stat can apply to individual players, teams, or everyone in the match. It can also generate a Level that will increment by 1 each time Value reaches *Max Value*, resetting Value to 0 when Level increments.

## Inheritance Hierarchy

This class is derived from the following hierarchy, starting with `creative_object`:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`creative_object`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object) | Base class for creative devices and props. |
| [`creative_device_base`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_device_base) | Base class for creative\_device. |

## Members

This class has both data members and functions.

### Data

| Data Member Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LevelChangedEvent` | `listenable(payload)` | Signaled when the stat changes Level. Sends a tuple of the instigating `agent` (or `false` if none) and the new Level. |
| `MaximumReachedEvent` | `listenable(payload)` | Signaled when an `agent` reaches the maximum stat value. This occurs when the stat reaches *Max Value* if the device has no levels, or *Max Level* if that option is set. Sends the `agent` that caused the stat event that changed the level and the new level as an `int` . |
| `ValueChangedEvent` | `listenable(payload)` | Signaled when the stat changes Value. Sends a tuple of the instigating `agent` (or `false` if none) and the new Value. Value increases to a maximum of *Max Value*. If the stat has not yet reached *Max Level* then Value will reset to 0 and Level will increment by 1. |

### Functions

| Function Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`GetLevel`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getlevel) | Returns stat Level for `Agent`. Succeeds if *Number of Levels* is set to greater than 0, *Scope* is set to *Player* and `Agent` passes the requirement checks on the device. |
| [`GetLevel`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getlevel-1) | Returns stat Level for `Team`. Succeeds if *Number of Levels* is set to greater than 0, *Scope* is set to *Team* and the `Team` passes the requirement checks on the device. |
| [`GetLevelForMatch`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getlevelformatch) | Returns stat Level for the match. Succeeds if *Number of Levels* is set to greater than 0 and *Scope* is set to *Match*. |
| [`GetName`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getname) | Returns the name for the stat that is generated by this Stat Creator. |
| [`GetTransform`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/gettransform) | Returns the transform of the `creative_object` with units in cm. You must check `creative_object.IsValid` before calling this if there is a possibility the object has been disposed or destroyed by gameplay. Otherwise a runtime error will result. |
| [`GetValue`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getvalue) | Returns stat Value for `Agent`. Succeeds if *Scope* is set to *Player* and `Agent` passes the requirement checks on the device. |
| [`GetValue`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getvalue-1) | Returns stat Value for `Team`. Succeeds if *Scope* is set to *Team* and `Team` passes the requirement checks on the device. |
| [`GetValueForMatch`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/getvalueformatch) | Returns stat Value for the match. Succeeds if *Scope* is set to *Match*. |
| [`MoveTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/moveto) | Moves the `creative_object` to the specified `Position` and `Rotation` over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the `creative_object` it will be stopped and put into the `AnimationNotSet` state. |
| [`MoveTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/moveto-1) | Moves the `creative_object` to the specified `Transform` over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the `creative_object` it will be stopped and put into the `AnimationNotSet` state. |
| [`SetLevel`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/setlevel) | Updates stat Level for `Agent`. Succeeds if *Number of Levels* is set to greater than 0 and *Scope* is set to *Agent*. Altering stat Level will set `Agent`'s stat Value to 0. |
| [`SetLevel`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/setlevel-1) | Updates stat Level for `Team`. Succeeds if *Number of Levels* is set to greater than 0 and *Scope* is set to *Team*. Altering stat Level will set `Team`'s stat Value to 0. |
| [`SetLevelForMatch`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/setlevelformatch) | Updates stat Level for the match.

| [`SetValue`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/setvalue) | Updates stat Value for `Agent`. Succeeds if *Scope* is set to *Agent* and `Agent` passes the requirement checks on the device. If the stat does not have levels, `Value` is clamped between 0 and *Max Value*. If the stat does have levels, the Value is not clamped and setting a value below 0 or above *Max Value* will decrement or increment the level appropriately. e.g. if *Number of Levels* is 10, *Max Value is 100* and you are currently level 0, a `Value` of 550 will set you to Level 5 and Value 50. |
| [`SetValue`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/setvalue-1) | Updates stat Value for `Team`. Succeeds if *Scope* is set to *Team* and `Team` passes the requirement checks on the device. If the stat does not have levels, `Value` is clamped between 0 and *Max Value*. If the stat does have levels, the Value is not clamped and setting a value below 0 or above *Max Value* will decrement or increment the level appropriately. e.g. if *Number of Levels* is 10, *Max Value is 100* and you are currently level 0, a `Value` of 550 will set you to Level 5 and Value 50. |
| [`SetValueForMatch`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/stat_creator_device/setvalueformatch) | Updates stat Value for the match. Succeeds if *Scope* is set to *Match*. If the stat does not have levels, `Value` is clamped between 0 and *Max Value*. If the stat does have levels, the Value is not clamped and setting a value below 0 or above *Max Value* will decrement or increment the level appropriately. e.g. if *Number of Levels* is 10, *Max Value is 100* and you are currently level 0, a `Value` of 550 will set you to Level 5 and Value 50. |
| [`TeleportTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/teleportto) | Teleports the `creative_object` to the specified `Position` and `Rotation`. |
| [`TeleportTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/teleportto-1) | Teleports the `creative_object` to the specified location defined by `Transform`, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
