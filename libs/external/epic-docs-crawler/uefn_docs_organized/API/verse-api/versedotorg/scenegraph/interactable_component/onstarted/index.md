Called from Start if CanInteract pass successfully to start the interaction. Overriding this function will allow you to create a custom interaction behaviour.

| Verse `using` statement | `using { /Verse.org/SceneGraph }` |

`OnStarted<protected><native><native_callable>(Agent:agent)<transacts><decides>:void`

## Parameters

`OnStarted` takes the following parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Agent` | `agent` |  |

## Attributes, Specifiers, and Effects

### Specifiers

The following specifiers determine how you can interact with `OnStarted` in your programs. For the complete list of specifiers, see the [Specifiers Page](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).

| Specifier | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `protected` | The identifier is only accessible in the current class and any subtypes. You can use this on classes, interfaces, structs, enums, non-module methods, and data. |
| `native` | Indicates that the definition details of the element are implemented in C++. Verse definitions with the `native` specifier auto-generate C++ definitions that a developer can then fill out its implementation. You can use this specifier on classes, interfaces, enums, methods, and data. |
| `native_callable` | Indicates that an instance method is both native (implemented in C++) and may be called by other C++ code. You can see this specifier used on an instance method. This specifier doesn't propagate to subclasses and so you don't need to add it to a definition when overriding a method that has this specifier. |

### Effects

The following effects determine how `OnStarted` behaves in your programs. For the complete list of effects, see the Effect Specifers section of the [Specifiers Page](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/specifiers-and-attributes-in-verse).

| Effect | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `transacts` | This effect indicates that any actions performed by the function can be rolled back. The transacts effect is required any time a mutable variable (`var`) is written. You'll be notified when you compile your code if the `transacts` effect was added to a function that can't be rolled back. Note that this check is not done for functions with the `native` specifier. |
| `decides` | Indicates that the function can fail, and that calling this function is a [failable expression](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/failure-in-verse#failableexpression). Function definitions with the `decides` effect must also have the `transacts` effect, which means the actions performed by this function can be rolled back (as if the actions were never performed), if there's a failure anywhere in the function. |
