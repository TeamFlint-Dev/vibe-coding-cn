The Guard Spawner can spawn a group of enemies that patrol an area to protect it from players. Like sentries, guards have a detection system. This means players can disguise themselves or engage in stealth tactics, which gives players more strategic options for gameplay. Unlike sentries, however, guards will act as a team to attack players, or help other guards on their team.
