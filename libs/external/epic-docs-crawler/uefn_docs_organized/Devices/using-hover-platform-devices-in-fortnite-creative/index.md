The **Hover Platform** device is a square platform that can be placed in midair, and that your players can stand on. You can use this to create jumping puzzles or other game elements that involve your players standing in midair above the rest of the island.

The Hover Platform device is not customizable.

This device can be destroyed by pressing **F** and attacking it with your pickaxe. The pickaxe will not destroy the device if **Pickaxe Destruction** is set to **None** in [My Island Settings.](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)
