In UEFN, you have access to all the devices available in Fortnite Creative, but there are also devices that you can only use with UEFN.

Once you've placed a UEFN-only device on your island, you might also be able to modify the device options in Creative during a Live Edit session, depending on the device.

You can also customize or even build your own devices in UEFN using Verse.

To learn more about all of the devices available, see the full list of documented devices under [Using Devices](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative) .

For any Creative design examples in the [Device Design Examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative), you can also make these examples in UEFN.
