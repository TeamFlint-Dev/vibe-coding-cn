The **Creepin’ Cardboard** device is an environmental object that players can interact with. When placed, it looks like a large cardboard box, with one of several possible random skins. [In-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), players can approach the box and press **E** to hide inside. Press and hold **E** to exit the Creepin’ Cardboard device.

While hiding in the Creepin’ Cardboard device, players can move around slowly, collect weapons and items, and can pop up out of the box to fire weapons by holding the right mouse button to aim. However, players will need to exit the Creepin’ Cardboard to reload. Exiting a Creepin’ Cardboard device does not destroy it; players can reuse it. A Creepin’ Cardboard device is destroyed if it takes any damage when not in use.

Unlike most devices, Creepin’ Cardboard devices cannot be customized in any way, and have no options.
