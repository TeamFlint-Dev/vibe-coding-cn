The player will load into an introductory room that offers a general overview of the expected objectives. In this room, you will find a Player Spawn Pad which spawns a single player on the pad. For maps with multiple players, each player will need their own spawn pad, otherwise they will spawn in the sky and drop down from their parachute. You have the option to make Player Spawn Pads invisible and specify which teams can spawn from them.

On the wall, you will find a Billboard that offers customizable text to display informative messages to the player. You can alter the text size, justification, and viewing distance through the device options. Billboards with transparent borders will collide with the background and should be used cautiously.

[![Lock](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82bf96d0-f11a-4a33-93e1-46b213c60fb1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/82bf96d0-f11a-4a33-93e1-46b213c60fb1?resizing_type=fit)

The next room also has instructional billboards that inform the player of the required objectives needed to advance into the next room. Billboards are an effective way to advance gameplay for players who are both unfamiliar with the game rules or need a simple reminder.

To unlock the door, the player must open a Chest to collect the items needed for the Conditional Button.

When changing walls and floors, be sure to detach any connected devices such as Conditional Buttons and Lock devices. Any device attached to a replaced tile will be deleted.

When the player enters Section D, they will pass through an invisible trigger that activates the Map Indicator device. The player will then have icons that show their current location and objectives on the map. Through the device options, you can alter settings such as the displayed text, the icon color, and map visibility.
