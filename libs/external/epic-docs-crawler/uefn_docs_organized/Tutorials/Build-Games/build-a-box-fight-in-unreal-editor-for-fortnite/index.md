[Box Fight](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/design-a-1v1-box-fight-in-fortnite-creative) is a fast-paced shooting game where players try to eliminate each other in a very limited space. Barriers separate the players before the game starts, allowing each player to quickly build defenses before the barriers drop.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to create a box fight game in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**.

If this is your first time using UEFN, take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with basic [Controls](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/guide-to-uefn-controls-for-creative-users-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [Outliner Tips](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/outliner-tips-and-tricks-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) in UEFN.

UEFN provides a way for you to playtest your level at any point in the production process. Click the **Launch Session** button located on the upper left side of your viewer:
