**Rocket Racing islands** are UEFN templates where you can make your own racetrack using the Rocket Racing toolset. You can make your own tracks and define your racing mode, depending on how you want your race to run.

Rocket Racing islands use custom devices, so take a look at the [full list of devices](using-rocket-racing-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to see your options. To learn how to make a racetrack from start to finish, see [Creating Rocket Racing Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-rocket-racing-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

## Before You Take Off

If you're going to build your own Rocket Racing island, there are a few things you should know.

Rocket Racing island templates are not like other Fortnite islands — they have a specialized toolset specifically for creating racetracks that can accommodate these crazy, fast cars.

There are tutorials and device docs that show you how to get the most out of these tools and devices. There are also island templates, with companion docs for each.

Check out [**Working with Rocket Racing Islands**](working-with-rocket-racing-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) for what you can and can't do on a Rocket Racing island.

## Create Your Own Rocket Racing Island

You have two racing modes to choose from:

- **Competitive:** This is where all players are on the track at the same time, doing the same number of laps, and the player who's vehicle crosses the finish line first is the winner.
- **Speed Run:** Can be played solo or with multiple players, but instead of racing against others, the player is racing to beat their own best time in a session, with the result logged against global learderboards.

Follow the steps below to create your project.

1. In the **Island Templates** section of the **Project Browser**, select either **Competitive Race Track** or **Speed Run Track**.
