When you open the LEGO® inventory, you're opening the door to a world of LEGO Elements and assets! This exclusive content is at your disposal for your building fun. [LEGO Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#lego-elements) can be mixed and matched with Fortnite props to create the ultimate experience.

These LEGO assets come pre-built, so you don’t have to worry about losing pieces, adding too many bricks, or accidentally skipping an instruction step!

Use these custom LEGO assets in Fortnite to create weird, wacky, wonderful experiences with the fun and color you'd expect.

Some assets in the **Content** tab or **Content** browser may not be available for a certain brand. This is because islands created with an external brand should reflect the vibe, tone, and idea behind the brand. For example, Fall Guys Beans are cute and playful — it's never appropriate for them to use weapons because that does not align with the Fall Guys brand. Similarly, not all of the Fortnite assets are available in LEGO® Islands because they are not Minifigure-compatible (Minifigures do have small hands, after all).

Make sure to check out each brand's introduction blog post and the accompanying documentation so you get the full understanding of what is (and isn't) okay within a specific brand and why.

All LEGO animals, props, houses and other assets are cataloged under **LEGO®** in the Content menu for Creative and the **Content Browser** for UEFN.

To learn more on how to build a LEGO Island, see [Working with LEGO® Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-lego-islands-in-fortnite-creative).

All Fortnite original props, prefabs, and galleries or icons that have a military theme are not available on LEGO Islands.

Within Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), you can also open the **Content Drawer** and navigate to **All**> **LEGO® Content**to access additional assets like materials and audio files.

## Prefabs and Galleries

Prefabs and galleries are ready-made building blocks for your LEGO creations. They include detailed LEGO builds and collections of assets that you can place, customize, and combine to shape your island.

To learn more, see [Using Prefabs and Galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prefabs-and-galleries-in-fortnite-creative).

Larger prefabs and galleries can affect island memory. To learn more about optimizing your islands performance, see [Building with LEGO Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-lego-islands-in-fortnite-creative#building-with-lego-elements).

### Prefabs

Prefabs are themed LEGO builds that can help you get started quickly. They're designed to save time while letting you focus on creativity. Each prefab is fully editable, you can rebuild it, resize it, or mix pieces from multiple prefabs to create something new.

Use prefabs as foundations, landmarks, or gameplay spaces. They're flexible and meant to inspire experimentation rather than prescribe a specific type of game or environment.

### Galleries

Galleries provide groups of individual LEGO assets, from furniture and foliage to structural pieces and decorations. They let you handpick and assemble elements that fit your island's design.

You can use galleries to fill in details, expand prefabs, or build original structures completely from scratch.

You can pull individual props directly from the Props folder in the Content Browser directly into your island. This gives you access to single objects from a prefab or gallery so you can place and customize them without using the full set.

### Brick Modules

Brick modules are preassembled brick-built pieces, similar to gallery assets. You can combine these pieces together to build out your environment design. These modular pieces are not designed to be separated back into individual bricks.

For UEFN projects, you can use Brick Modules as placed elements and create additional designs with the Brick Editor. Use the Brick Editor to build new brick-by-brick structures that complement or extend the modules you place.

To learn more, see [Working with the LEGO® Brick Editor](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-the-lego-brick-editor-in-fortnite).

## Devices

There are almost 100 Fortnite devices available for LEGO Islands. All of these devices are [Minifigure-compatible](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and have the same options as in Fortnite. However, not all devices are available on LEGO Islands.

Patchwork devices use Fortnite's regular scale. This means Minifigures don't need glasses to read all the knob labels!

Some devices are designed specifically to support LEGO gameplay and player interaction. These include:

- [Assembly Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lego-assembly-devices-in-fortnite-creative): Custom to LEGO Islands is the Assembly device, which you can use to build and disassemble props with a single button.
- [Collectible Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lego-collectible-devices-in-fortnite-creative): Lets you add LEGO Elements that players can pick up, and use as part of island gameplay. You can customize these devices to support different types of objectives or game styles.

Certain devices are reviewed by Fortnite and LEGO moderation teams for features they support to ensure the island is compliant with the [**LEGO® Brand and Creator Rules**](lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative). This includes:

- Devices that support text input.
- Spawners and spawned items provided to players.

### LEGO Styles

You can expand your island with LEGO Minifigures as NPCs with the **NPC Spawner** device. Through the device you can choose and manage over 500 [LEGO Styles](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#lego-styles). You can change the LEGO Style to match the theme of your experience, create visual variety, or distinguish groups of characters. To learn more, see [NPC Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

In Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), LEGO Styles are controlled through [NPC Character Modifiers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#npc-character-modifiers). To use LEGO Styles in the **NPC Spawner** device, create a new**NPC Character Definition**, and use the **Character Cosmetic NPC Modifier**.

To learn more about updating an NPC's style, inventory, or behavior, see the [NPC Character Definitions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) page.

## Tools and Weapons

LEGO Islands can include tools and weapons which are [Minifigure-compatible](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#minifigure-compatible). These classic Fortnite tools and weapons have been redesigned to be used by Minifigures. You can place them in your LEGO experience, included in chests, or configured through devices to support objectives, progression, and player interaction.

You can find tools, weapons, and ammo within Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Open the **Content Drawer** and navigate to **All > LEGO® Content > Weapons**.

### Tools

Tools are utility objects that minifigures can carry and use. You can place tools as world pickups, added to chests, or granted through devices to support quests, crafting loops, or other progression mechanics.

You can place weapons as pickups in the world, added to containers, granted as rewards, or used in combat-based objectives. They can support challenges, adventure gameplay, or reward systems.

Some weapons are available in different rarities. Higher-rarity versions often feature improved stats such as durability or effectiveness.

You can place Items directly in the world, grant them through devices, or use them as part of quests or objectives.

You can find Items within Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Open the **Content Drawer** and navigate to **All > LEGO® Content > Items**.

### Collectibles

Collectibles are Items that players can pick up and hold for later use. They often serve as resources, quest items, or currency in your island.
