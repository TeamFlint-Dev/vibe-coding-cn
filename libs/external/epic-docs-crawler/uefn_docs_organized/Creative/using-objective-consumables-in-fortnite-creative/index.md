![Registering Consumables](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/images/4aa84348-17f3-4376-9ab3-4ff47826a781/registering-consumables.png)

To register items to a device, stand directly on or immediately beside the device.

To register an item for this kind of device, follow these steps. You can also watch a [video tutorial](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/RegisteringCraftingConsumablesinFortniteCreative/1_zpmj3v0g) that shows you how to register items, both crafting and usable.

1. In the CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY** inventory screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item. Compatible devices that can hold items include:

- **Vending Machine**
- **Team Settings & Inventory**
- **Class Designer**
- **Capture Item Spawner**
- **Capture Area**
- **Item Granter**
- **Item Spawner**
- **Conditional Button**
- **Elimination Manager**
- **Item Remover**

Use these devices to set up your own system for granting and spawning items onto your island.

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange items for another.

To do so, you can choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require [**Rainbow Crystals**](/documentation/404) and [**Malachite Ore**](/documentation/404) as items needed to craft **Jewels**.
