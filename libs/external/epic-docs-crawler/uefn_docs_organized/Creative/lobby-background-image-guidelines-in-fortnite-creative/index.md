Your islands can now have their own custom background images in the [lobby](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) where players gather and wait for the island to load. This is similar to the original Fortnite lobby, but specific to your island.

Your lobby will have a default background image, or you can use images from other creators that are available for upload from the Creator Portal, but customizing the lobby background is an opportunity for you to immerse the player into your game before it even starts!

Lobby backgrounds should follow the same general guidelines for any island images.

If you don’t upload a background, the default will be the current Fortnite Battle Royale lobby background. You can also download from a collection of stock backgrounds. For more information on how to access these images, see [Creating Custom Lobby Backgrounds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-custom-lobby-backgrounds-in-fortnite-creative).

There are a few general points to keep in mind when creating any images related to your island. All images should:

- Accurately represent your game.
- Be engaging.
- Follow all of the [brand guidelines](https://brand.epicgames.com/d/KCYRTaiFZuRz/guidance#/guidance) for Fortnite.
- Follow the [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules).

## Common Lobby Background Submission Errors

Any image taken for the purpose of a lobby background must follow the points below:

- It must represent Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).
- The image has to be true to the island experience (this only applies to custom images, not stock or default images).
- It cannot have advertisements or hidden suggestions in the background, or in reflections.
- All imagery and text must follow all applicable Fortnite Island Creator Rules (1.2 Keep Personal Information Private, 1.10 Appropriate Language Only, 1.15.7 Promotional Materials, 1.13.3 Keep it Authentic, 1.19 Follow Epic’s Style Requirements, and 4.2.2 Support-A-Creator Program).  Any text must not interfere with the top navigation area.

  [![image should avoid the top navigation area](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93a967f0-b006-432d-b4a4-82d01774fdeb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93a967f0-b006-432d-b4a4-82d01774fdeb?resizing_type=fit)

  Be sure your text does not interfere with the top navigation area of your lobby background, displayed above in red.
- The image cannot contain images of real people or any personal identifiable information.
- It must not contain any third-party intellectual property.
- It should not include social media handles.

Violation of any of the above will result in [moderation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) failure for the image and for publishing the island.

## Creating Your Own Custom Images

If you use the **Creative Photo Mode** tool available in Fortnite Creative, it will automatically generate an image in the correct size and dimensions.

This tool is only available in Fortnite Creative. To capture a background image in UEFN, you'll need to use a different screen-capture tool.

If you use other screen-capture software, the image you use for your lobby background needs to be **2048 x 1024**, and should not exceed **10 MB**. Supported file types are **PNG**, **JPG**, and **JPEG**.

Make sure the final image matches these dimensions, and accommodates the overlays used as shown in [Creating Custom Lobby Backgrounds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-custom-lobby-backgrounds-in-fortnite-creative).

Below are a couple of images that show good pre-placement framing.
