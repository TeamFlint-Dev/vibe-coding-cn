2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.

4. Click the item, then click either **Equip** or **Add To Chest**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). When you're back in Create mode, you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) by pressing the **F** key.

*To register items to a device, stand directly on or immediately beside the device.*

To register an item for this kind of device, follow the steps below. (You can also watch a [video tutorial](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/RegisteringCraftingConsumablesinFortniteCreative/1_zpmj3v0g) that shows you how to register items, for [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting) or other [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game) use.)

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange one item or group of items for another.

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **[Guzzle Juice](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Fibrous Herbs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-healing-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft a **Slap Juice**.
