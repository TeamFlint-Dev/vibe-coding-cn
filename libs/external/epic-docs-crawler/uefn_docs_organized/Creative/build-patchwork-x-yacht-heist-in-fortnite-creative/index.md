**Patchwork x Yacht Heist** is a single-player stealth island with an adaptive custom soundtrack created using **Fortnite Patchwork**. The template teaches [vertical (layered)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#vertical-composition) and [horizontal (track-based)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#horizontal-composition) game composition, which are core concepts in creating [game soundtracks](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#adaptive-music).

The Yacht Heist is divided into two main phases: **Sneak** and **Escape**.

In the Sneak phase, the player steals a keycard and makes their way down to the vault. They blow open the vault, revealing the jewel inside. During this phase, the music stays tense, with added instruments when the player is noticed by guards.

When the player picks up the jewel, the Escape phase begins. They are given more powerful weapons as many more guards arrive. They must blow their way to the front of the yacht to escape. At the beginning of this phase, the music switches to a fast, high-energy track to underscore the drama of the escape.

The Patchwork x Yacht Heist template shows you how to use Patchwork on your island to enhance your gameplay with music!

To follow along on the template island, open **Creative**, walk up to your golden rift, and create a new island based on the **Yacht Heist** template. This will give you the ability to fly around the island and edit.

Alternatively, you can play the island by using the **2345-5615-0218** island code to see how it comes together in-game.
