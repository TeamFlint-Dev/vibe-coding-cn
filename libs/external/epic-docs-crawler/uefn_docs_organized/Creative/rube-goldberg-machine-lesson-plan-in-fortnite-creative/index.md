## Lesson Overview

Who doesn’t love a good Rube Goldberg Machine? Full of humor and wit, and based on simple machines, Rube Goldberg inventions are described as overly complex machines comprised of a number of automated actions to solve a simple problem. I can only imagine how thrilled Rube would have been if Fortnite Creative had been available in his day. In this lesson, students will learn about simple machines, engineering, and automation. They will design and build a Rube Goldberg Machine in Fortnite, using the Creative toolset.

We hope you’re not afraid of heights…

Students will create a Rube Goldberg Machine using Fortnite Creative. In the process, they will:

- Learn about simple machines.
- Apply the Design Thinking Model to create a complex solution to a simple problem.
- Demonstrate an understanding of automation, physics, and engineering principles as they design and build their functioning machine.
- Develop and test hypotheses while engaging in the iterative design process.

### ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS/BIG IDEAS

- How does the design thinking process support creative problem solving?
- How does hypothesis development and testing inform the design process?
- How do simple machines contribute to automation?

### LEARNING OUTCOMES/OBJECTIVES

The student will be able to:

- Identify simple machines and their purposes.
- Develop and test a hypothesis.
- Create a Rube Goldberg machine comprised of a variety of simple machines that create a complex solution to a simple problem.
- Create a problem in order to develop a solution.
- Understand some of the basic principles of physics.

## LEARNING ACTIVITIES

### Hook

Show a selection of the following videos (These could be shown at different points throughout the project to maintain excitement about what’s possible):

- [Baller’s Adventure Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvFl4wro4BU): A Rube Goldberg Machine Created in Fortnite Creative
- [Audri’s Monster Trap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMboI4cOAuQ)
- [This Too Shall Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qybUFnY7Y8w): OK Go Music Video Featuring Rube Goldberg Machine
- [Getting an Ice Cream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtDGDTUDO-8): Purdue Society of Professional Engineers Rube Goldberg Team 2016

### Instruction: Rube Goldberg, Simple Machines, and The Design Process

1. [Rube Goldberg: A Cultural Icon](https://www.rubegoldberg.org/all-about-rube/a-cultural-icon/): Read and discuss.
2. [Simple Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MORlORm_6Dg): Watch, then review the types of simple machines:

   - Lever
   - Wheel and axle
   - Inclined plane
   - Wedge
   - Pulley
   - Screw
3. Have students define simple machines in their own words, and identify examples of each from everyday life ([sample
   worksheet](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/attachments/60ce8d59-9f61-4161-b871-bc60c5c71ff8/rube-goldberg-student-handout.pdf) attached.)
4. Discuss the Engineering Design Process / Iterative Design Process:
   https://www.teachengineering.org/k12engineering/designprocess

### Exploration

Experiment with Fortnite Creative to get a sense of the different devices and how they work in order to automate functions in the game.

- Create one automated process using Fortnite Creative. Use the building tools (prefabs, galleries, devices, and so on).

### Iterative Design Process

[![iterative design proceess](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3c3f8876-2e53-46dc-bc5d-cdf881ce43ca?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3c3f8876-2e53-46dc-bc5d-cdf881ce43ca?resizing_type=fit)

1. **Design:** Determine a simple problem to solve (such as getting a ball into a basket):

   - This could be a problem provided by the teacher, or students can come up with their own simple problem to solve.
   - Develop an elaborate (complex) plan to solve this simple problem.
   - Develop a storyboard (series of sketches) to brainstorm the problem and its solution.
2. **Develop:** Begin development in Fortnite based on initial design /storyboard.
3. **Peer Testing / Feedback**
4. **Iterate:** Iterate on initial design based on feedback
5. **Peer Testing / Feedback**
6. **Complete Rube Goldberg Machine:** Complete the project based on final feedback.
7. **Create Video Walkthrough:** Optional if unable to show project in Fortnite.

### Culminating Activity

Gallery walk or video presentations.
