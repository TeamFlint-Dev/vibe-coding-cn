Engagement payouts proportionally distribute a percentage of the net revenue from Fortnite’s Item Shop and most real-money purchases to all island publishers on a monthly basis. Payouts are based on what players enjoy in Fortnite and account for island popularity, engagement, attracting new players, and other measurements described below.

We will continue to update the metrics that calculate engagement payouts to account for the current state of tools in both Fortnite’s creator ecosystem and our roadmap.

Epic’s existing [Support-A-Creator (SAC)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/sac) program is separate from the Engagement Payout program.

The calculation of your island’s engagement will be determined for the calendar month, which means from the first of the month to the end. Payouts occur **30 days** after the end of the calendar month.

Engagement payouts are available to creators 18 years of age and older.

## Program Requirements

To be eligible for engagement payouts you must meet the following criteria:

- Your Epic account must have been active in Fortnite for 30 days, at least 7 of which must have included time editing islands in Fortnite Creative or Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).
- You must accept the [Creator Engagement Program Agreement](https://create.fortnite.com/enroll), either on behalf of yourself or the legal entity that you represent.
- You or the legal entity’s representative must be at least 18 years old.
- You must abide by the Creator Content [guidelines](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules).
- You must be able to receive payments using Epic’s current payment platform(s), [Hyperwallet](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/hyperwallet-setup-in-fortnite-creative).
- If you meet the requirements above, you can enroll in the engagement payouts program and contribute to the Fortnite Creative ecosystem.

When you’re accepted into the program, you’ll see new engagement and payout data in the Monetization Payout tab of Creator Portal where you track your earnings.

## How It Works: The Engagement Pool

Fortnite creators enrolled in the Engagement Payout program receive payouts based on player engagement in their islands. 40% of the eligible net revenue from Fortnite’s Item Shop and related real-money purchases is placed into an Engagement Pool, which is distributed among creators' and Epic's islands based on the Engagement Payout Formula.

This net revenue is the value of all eligible V-Bucks spending and real money purchases, adjusted for applicable taxes and third-party fees that are deducted by Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, and other sellers of Fortnite before they transfer funds to Epic.  Where Epic processes payments directly (such as on Windows and certain mobile devices), only third-party payment processing fees (such as credit card processing and PayPal fees) are deducted.

Once that amount has been determined, we reserve 60% of it to fund Epic’s ongoing operations and Fortnite ecosystem development. These expenditures include:

- Core ecosystem software and service development
- Shared game art
- Cosmetic creation, merchandising, and third-party IP licensing fees
- IT, hosting, and liveops infrastructure
- Player acquisition, marketing, and distribution
- Customer support
- Content moderation
- Affiliate Support-A-Creator payments

In addition to 40% of eligible net revenue, 50% of sponsorship revenue generated by [Sponsored Row campaigns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/campaigns-in-fortnite) will go into the engagement payout pool, boosting the pool size for all creators. From the launch of this feature through the end of 2026, this rate will be 100%.

## How It Works: Engagement Payout Formula

The goal of engagement payouts is to compensate island creators for the value they bring to Fortnite through engagement, as measured by island engagement metrics from Fortnite players who have made a real money purchase on their accounts. This includes all Fortnite players who have ever purchased V-Bucks Packs or retail V-Bucks gift cards, completed real money transactions like Starter Packs or Quest Packs, subscribed to Fortnite Crew, or purchased Save the World.

Engagement from these players is measured in the following metrics, which make up the Engagement Payout Formula:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Active Playtime | Active time players spend on your island |
| Island Retention | Players returning to your island on subsequent days after playing it. |
| Playtime Surrounding Item Shop V-Bucks Spend | Active time within a week (before and after) a player spent V-Bucks in the Item Shop. |
| User Acquisition Rewards: New Players | When a player comes to Fortnite for the very first time to play your island, you receive 75% of that player’s contributions to the Engagement Pool for the next six months. These contributions are the value of that player’s V-Bucks spending in the Item Shop. |
| User Acquisition Rewards: Returning Players | When a player who has not played Fortnite in over six months returns to play your island, you receive 75% of that player’s contributions to the Engagement Pool for the next six months. These contributions are the value of that player’s V-Bucks spending in the Item Shop. |

Attribution for new and lapsed players is determined as follows:

- **In-game search and direct links**: Players who reach their first island by searching for it or via [direct link](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/links-in-fortnite-creative) are fully attributed to that island.
- **First-day playtime**: Players who reach their first island via Discover (not search or direct links) will have their engagement pool contributions divided among the islands they play on their first day, based on the percentage of time played per island.

Currently, attribution through links is supported for new players on PC, and for returning players on PC and mobile. Attribution through links is not supported for players in the European Union. Attribution from other methods is supported on all platforms and regions.

## Monetization In Creator Portal

To access Monetization data for your project, navigate to the individual project page's **Monetization** section. This section provides an overview of your payouts as well as estimations based on the available data.

Some data may take several days to process, so estimates for the most recent seven days are less precise than estimates further in the past. Additionally, multiple factors can make this data inaccurate, including but not limited to your Creator eligibility status, receiving a monetization ban, or any other factors leading to payout disruption. Estimates may still be visible for any days your account or island is ineligible to receive a payout.

Note that payouts only happen once you’ve hit the $100 minimum threshold within a 12 month window (read the [engagement program terms](https://www.fortnite.com/engagement-program-payout-terms)). If you have transferred island ownership, you will not see estimates or received payout data for days where you were not the owner.
