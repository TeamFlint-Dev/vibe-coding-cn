*Use the devices like Conditional Button and Item Spawner to create the system of crafting.*

You could pair **Spectralite Ore** with [Blast Powder](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-power-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative) as materials needed to craft other items or weapons like the **Shadow Midas' Drum Gun**.

To do so, you will need to set the Conditional Button's setting **Key Items Required** to **2** and pair the device with an [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to grant the usable item.

You can also blend items with [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) of similar [themes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) from the **Galleries** and **Prefabs** tab.

*This Galleries prop can be found in Zero Point Nature Gallery.*

For example, you can blend Spectralite Ore with rock and mineral props for an immersive gameplay.

To create the process of crafting, you will need to either [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) the item onto your map with the Item Spawner or [grant](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grant) them to players through the **Item Granter**.

Players can collect these items to exchange for usable items through devices like Conditional Button, which consumes equipped items. They can also use these items to craft other items that will build up to a larger item.

## Finding and Placing Items

[![Finding Mineral Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/134d0760-32c5-4d79-8d65-667e6540909f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/134d0760-32c5-4d79-8d65-667e6540909f?resizing_type=fit)

1. From [Build mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), press the **Tab** key, then click **Creative** on the [top navigation bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to select the [Creative inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen if not already displayed.
2. Click the **Items** tab.
3. On this screen, scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then click either **Equip** or **Add To Chest**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resources-bar). (When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**.)

You may want to offer an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the [Chest tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Each time you click it, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the **Chest** tab.

From the **Chest** tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a Chest or a Llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).

You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab.

## Managing Items

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the **Play** inventory, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from your Resources bar.

[![Mineral Resources Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ce9dbedb-0db9-4467-b9e7-30ad25e2a438?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ce9dbedb-0db9-4467-b9e7-30ad25e2a438?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

You can drop items directly onto devices that can either hold or grant items. Above shows the Conditional Button, which holds two crafting items and an Item Spawner that holds one usable item.

This pair of devices can be set up for players to exchange Spectralite Ores and Blast Powder for a Shadow Midas' Drum Gun. To do so, these items must first be [registered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) to the devices that will hold the information.
