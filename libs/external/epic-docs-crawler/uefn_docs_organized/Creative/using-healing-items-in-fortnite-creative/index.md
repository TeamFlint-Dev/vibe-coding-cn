**Healing [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)** are any items that can replenish damaged [health](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#health) for players. These items can either be consumed directly, or taken in through an [area of effect](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#aoe).

[![Player Health and Shield](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/07dddacf-bb44-4a51-882d-04c889abaf29?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/07dddacf-bb44-4a51-882d-04c889abaf29?resizing_type=fit)

*Health displays at the bottom left of the screen as a green bar with a plus icon to the left. The blue bar above it indicates the player’s shield.*

Health, like shield, has a bar that can be filled to **100**.

You can change the [My Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) option **Max Health** to alter the maximum health players can have during gameplay.

Healing items include:

- **Bandage**
- **Med Kit**
- **Med-Mist**
- **Slurp Juice**
- **Chug Jug**
- **Chug Splash**
- **Chili Chug Splash**
- **Bandage Bazooka**
- **Guzzle Juice**

There are many ways you can offer these items during gameplay. You can use devices like the [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [Vending Machine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-vending-machine-devices-in-fortnite-creative), or even offer them as item bundles through chests or llamas.

## Finding and Placing Items

1. From [Build mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), press the **Tab** key, then click **CREATIVE** on the [top navigation bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to select the [CREATIVE inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen if not already displayed.
2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.
3. Scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then click either **Equip** or **Add To Chest**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

When you're back in [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) by pressing the **F** key. You can select equipped items by either scrolling your middle mouse button or by pressing its corresponding number on your keyboard.

From the [Chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or a [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama) for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).

[![Health Chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ae8e8e29-cf13-4cb8-b705-304d3f36a5f6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ae8e8e29-cf13-4cb8-b705-304d3f36a5f6?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

Chests and llamas are a great way to offer item bundles to players. Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the **Chest** tab. Each time you click **Add To Chest**, the item count will increase by one, shown as a yellow box on the Chest tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab.

## Managing Items

[![Health Loadout Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8262aea1-bd7e-473f-868e-9c6d95cc6c36?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8262aea1-bd7e-473f-868e-9c6d95cc6c36?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. Here, you can swap item positions or drop them from your Equipment bar.

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to either spawn the items onto the map with the Item Spawner or grant them to players with the [**Item Granter**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.
