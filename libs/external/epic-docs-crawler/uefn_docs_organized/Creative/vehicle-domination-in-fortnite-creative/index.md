**Vehicle Domination** is a twist on the classic domination style game. Players select a class at the beginning of the game that determines which vehicle is available to them. Teams first rush to take the central capture point in their vehicles, and then attempt to capture their enemy’s base.

This template teaches you how to set up attack class structures and key domination gameplay elements. By the end of this template you’ll know how to use the Class Designer, Class Selector, and vehicle spawner devices to equip players and assign vehicles. You’ll also learn about creating team powerups and sophisticated bases.

The sample island code for this tutorial is **1499 7337 6072V1**.

To play through this island, click **CHANGE** on the Fortnite Lobby screen. On the Discover screen, click the **Island Code** tab and enter the code for **Vehicle Domination**. Once you've seen all the gameplay features, you can explore this template and recreate it on your own island.

## Props, Prefabs, and Galleries

A variety of assets from the **Military Gallery** Prefab sets were used to create three distinct bases and the central capture point.

When recreating this island, test your creativity by selecting a different terrain and theme for your island while mixing and matching items from various categories.

Fill any open areas with appealing props or gear players can pick up along the way that match your island’s theme. Create bottlenecks that cause opposing teams to battle head on, and secret pathways for surprise attacks.

Read the prerequisite tutorials to learn how to use Gallery pieces to build pre-game lobbies and arenas.

## Overview of Template Steps

Following is an overview of the steps you'll need to recreate this island, and its ideal sequence:

1. Create a new island using an island with existing terrain.
2. Set up the first team base.
3. Set up the pre-game lobby at the top of the base.
4. Set up the garage area and vehicle spawners.
5. Set up the central capture point.
6. Set up the central neutral base where players can find upgraded weapons and powerups.
7. Set up the second team base.

## Create Your Island

To build your island use the following steps.

1. Find your personal rift in the hub by locating the golden glow.
2. Use the console next to your rift to create a new island. Press **E** to enter the **GAME CREATION** screen and select **CREATE NEW**. This displays the Select Type dialog.
3. Under the tab **STARTER ISLAND**, there are three grid islands that vary by memory allocation (GRID ISLAND, LARGE GRID ISLAND, and XL GRID ISLAND). For this tutorial, it’s best to select an island that already has existing terrain.
4. After you click **CONFIRM**, type a name for your island, then click **CONFIRM** again.

The portal will automatically load and teleport you onto the island.
