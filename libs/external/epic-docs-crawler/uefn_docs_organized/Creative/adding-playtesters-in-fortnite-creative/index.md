Playtesters help to ensure island quality before publishing by working out the bugs and issues on your project through playtesting. This kind of quality control is part of a project release schedule and good practice for serious island creators.

Playtesters are people you invite to playtest your islands. They should be people you trust, and who will provide feedback on the quality of the experience and log any issues they encounter during gameplay.

Ideally, a playtester would look for possible issues with game mechanics, art, messaging, and clarity of goals in the game.

Playtesters do not have a hand in creating the island.

## Create a Playtest

To turn the **Private Version** of your island into a playtestable project, follow the steps below.

1. Open the **Projects** page and select **Playtests** from the tab menu.
2. Click **Create Playtest** and a Private Version panel opens.

3. Select the **Private Version** from the panel and click **Create Playtest**.

   [![Click Create Playtest](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4dd91d18-9961-4f54-968e-35e8e5fcee4c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4dd91d18-9961-4f54-968e-35e8e5fcee4c?resizing_type=fit)

This creates a special code playtesters can use to access the island. The Private Version code is also visible from the private code message. Click **Manage Playtest Group** to add playtesters to the project.

[![A new playtest code is created for the project](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c35b4ac4-7838-4fd4-bb0f-38d868334583?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c35b4ac4-7838-4fd4-bb0f-38d868334583?resizing_type=fit)

Clicking the **Manage Team** button on the playtest island code takes you to the **Manage Teams** page where you can add playtesters to your project.

## Adding Playtesters to a Project

Add playtesters to work in tandem with the project team. Follow the instructions below to invite playtesters to your team:

1. Click **Manage Team** from the main menu.
2. Click **Playtest Group** tab
3. Click **Add New Playtesters** from the tabbed options.

5. Paste the URL into an email.
6. Send the email to invite to people you trust to playtest your project.

The number of playtesters you can have is limited to 50. You’ll need to remove previous playtesters from the team if you want to add new playtesters.

When invitees accept the invitation, they are listed under the **Playtest Group** tab. Go into the Playtest Group tab to add playtesters to specific projects.

## Accepting a Playtest Invitation

All playtesters receive an email invitation to join a team.

As a playtester, when you receive an invitation, click the link in the email to open the **Epic Games Sign In** page. If you don’t have an Epic Games account, you’ll be prompted to create one.

1. Sign in to your Epic Games account.

3. You must be an adult to accept a Playtest Invitation. If you haven’t done so already, you will need to complete the age verification process.

If the team you’ve been invited to join is at capacity for playtesters, you’ll receive a message:

[![If the project already has maximum number of playtesters, you’ll receive an error message](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/981ca7cb-ef08-46b2-a9cb-746f01301cd5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/981ca7cb-ef08-46b2-a9cb-746f01301cd5?resizing_type=fit)

Contact the person who invited you to join the team.

## Removing Playtesters

You can remove playtesters from a project once their testing is complete, or if you no longer need the person to playtest.

Go to the **Playtesters** tab under **Manage Team** to remove playtesters.

1. Click the **ellipsis menu** next to the playtester’s name. The option to remove the playtester opens in a popup.

The island’s playtest code updates to a new code and shows the Private Version code for the newly selected version.
