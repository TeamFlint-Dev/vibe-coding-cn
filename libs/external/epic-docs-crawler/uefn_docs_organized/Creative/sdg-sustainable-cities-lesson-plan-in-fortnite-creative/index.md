## Lesson Overview

This challenge relates to [Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal11).

We’ve seen how games can change classrooms and communities for the better. Can they really help all of humanity thrive? The United Nations has **17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)** consisting of must-reach targets for the year 2030. These SDGs were specifically crafted with the purpose of supporting continued comfortable human life on Earth.

In this lesson, students will explore the concept of the **urban heat island (UHI) effect** and its impact on cities, with a specific focus on Tilted Towers in Fortnite Creative.

They will learn about the causes and consequences of the urban heat island effect, as well as the **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)** targets **11.3** and **11.6**, which emphasize inclusive and sustainable urbanization and environmental impact reduction.

Students will analyze the existing design of Tilted Towers and work independently or collaboratively to develop innovative solutions to mitigate the urban heat island effect and create a more comfortable and sustainable environment.

Through research, critical thinking, and creativity, students will implement their learning by redesigning Tilted Towers with features such as cool roofs, green spaces, reflective surfaces, and other strategies to combat extreme heat and promote a healthier urban environment.

By applying their knowledge to a virtual setting, students will gain a deeper understanding of the urban heat island effect and the importance of sustainable urban design for creating livable cities.

### Rationale

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, with a specific focus on targets 11.3 and 11.6, addresses the crucial need for inclusive and sustainable urbanization as well as the reduction of environmental impact in cities.

One significant environmental challenge cities face is the urban heat island effect, wherein urban areas experience higher temperatures than their surrounding rural areas. The implications of this phenomenon are profound and far-reaching.

Currently, more than half of the global population resides in urban areas, and this number is projected to increase further. The urban heat island effect impacts millions of people worldwide, particularly in densely populated cities where the effects are most pronounced.

Extreme heat events can result in heat-related illnesses, heat strokes, and even fatalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

Cities experience the urban heat island effect due to various factors. The high density of buildings, extensive paved surfaces, and limited green spaces contribute to the absorption and retention of heat.

Additionally, the high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with urbanization further exacerbate this effect. Therefore, addressing the urban heat island effect is crucial for creating sustainable cities and ensuring the well-being of their residents.

It is essential that we tackle the urban heat island effect to create a sustainable future. By implementing inclusive and sustainable urbanization strategies, we can mitigate the adverse impacts of extreme heat and enhance the livability of cities.

By incorporating measures such as increasing green spaces, utilizing cool roofs and reflective surfaces, and adopting urban planning approaches that prioritize shade and ventilation, we can combat the urban heat island effect. By doing so, we can create healthier, more resilient, and sustainable urban environments that benefit both current and future generations.

Statistics indicate that the majority of the world's population now lives in cities, highlighting the urgent need to address the urban heat island effect. By understanding the challenges posed by this phenomenon and the importance of sustainable urban development, we can work towards creating cities that are resilient, energy-efficient, and inclusive, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable and equitable future for all.

- [**Understand Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities (Secondary)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC456)

  This video explores the SDG 11 and is intended for a secondary school audience.
- [**Cities at risk of becoming "unliveable" as shrinking green spaces create "heat islands"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3cpk7sxIB4)

  A lack of tree cover in our major cities is going to make it nearly impossible to walk around during the height of summer, according to a new report.
- [**Heatwave: What is the urban heat island effect?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX3C3eq2MJY)

  Extreme heat is going to be felt across the country, but it's our cities that will be worst hit, as a phenomenon called the urban heat island effect drives temperatures even higher.

  - Show students the following video:

### Brainstorming and Planning a Solution

The next step is to begin the brainstorming and planning process.

Students can do this using the student handout and a pen or pencil and paper to sketch out what their island would look like.

1. Review Sustainable Development Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.
2. Brainstorm a list of UHI-relevant solutions.
3. Rank the list from most to least beneficial for reduction of the UHI effect at Tilted Towers.
4. Brainstorm possible engineering methods to provide innovative relief from UHI impact on citizens and all living organisms in the area.
5. Have the students state in their own words the exact problem that needs to be solved.
6. Discuss the [iterative design process](https://www.teachengineering.org/k12engineering/designprocess).
7. Use the [Heatwave Hideout Student Handout](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/attachments/797b188e-5571-40dd-91d9-eee9b63b8cf2/heatwave-hideout-student-handout.pdf) to help plan their UHI solutions based on the points above.

Consider including artificial lakes (blue zones), pocket parks, green rooftops, reflective materials, and vertical gardens.

These prefabs can be found under the [Creative Contents tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prefabs-and-galleries-in-fortnite-creative) in the **Prefabs** category.

Feel free to landscape and alter the island by removing trees and planting them elsewhere if needed.

Always attempt to balance nature and safety with the best solutions possible.

### Exploration and Knowledge Application with Fortnite Creative

Now that students have done some planning and brainstorming, it’s time to put that plan into action!

Students who are unfamiliar with Fortnite Creative can review the pages under [Starting Out in Fortnite Creative](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/get-started-creating-in-fortnite).

Also use the [Fortnite Creative Glossary](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for definitions of terms.

1. Students should begin implementing their Urban Heat Island solutions in Fortnite Creative using the Tilted Towers Island found under [Starter Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#starter-island).
2. Students should consider a mix of natural and artificial solutions.
3. They can use any and all of the building tools — prefabs, galleries, devices, and more, found under the Creative Contents tab.
4. Every few class periods, ask students to reflect on their work and compare it to their initial brainstorming and planning ideas. Introduce the idea of [iterative design](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#iterate) to help think about the new ideas and changes they are making to their islands.

### Alternative Activity: Unreal Editor for Fortnite

It is possible to take student solutions to another level of detail and skill.

Unreal Editor for Fortnite allows students to use industry-standard tools to build their Fortnite Creative solutions while adding assets far beyond the traditional Fortnite Creative prefabs.

Using this new and innovative approach will help to prepare students for a career in gaming and media production, and it requires only 1–2 hours extra to learn the required skills.

Here is a series of resources that can help students take advantage of this opportunity.
