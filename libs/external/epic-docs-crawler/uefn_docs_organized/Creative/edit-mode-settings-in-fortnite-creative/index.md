The [Creative toolset](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#creative-toolset) has modes, or ways of doing things. [**Edit mode**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#edit-mode) is a term used primarily in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite** but is similar to what's called [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode) in **Fortnite Creative**. What these modes have in common is that they are modes in which you can edit what's on your island as opposed to [Play mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-mode). (Edit Mode is used here because these settings are also shared with UEFN).

This is the mode you're in when you access your island from the [hub](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hub). In this mode, you can access [inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#inventory) items and island settings, you can place [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) and [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) on the island, and you can customize the devices you place.

The **Edit Mode** category provides ways to control settings so they better suit your needs when creating your island. From the **Island Settings** tab, click **Edit Mode**, then click a **subcategory** to expand it.

Any changes you make to these settings are automatically saved. You can restore the settings to their original values at any time by clicking the **Restore Defaults** button. This will reset only the settings for your current category.

Following are the Edit Mode settings. You can toggle these settings **On** or **Off**.

| Option | Value | Description |

| HUD - Show Health and Shield | Defaults to On. | Shows health and shield while you're in Edit/Create mode unless toggled off. |
