With **Creator Pages**, the Fortnite Discover UI makes it easier for players to find you and the islands you have published. The Creator Page is where all your published islands are displayed.

## In-game Creator Page

When you become an active member of the Island Creator & Engagement Program, your own Creator Page is generated in Discover. Players visit Creator Pages by clicking the **MORE FROM THIS CREATOR** button on the bottom of the screen.

As you publish islands through the Creator Portal, your Creator Page updates with the latest published island.

You’ll want to visit your Creator Page too: each island tile features a **concurrent user counter** that shows you how many players are playing your islands at that moment! Clicking on an island tile takes you to the island's **Island Details page** where you can view information about the island.

If you decide you don’t want a particular island to be featured on your Creator Page, you can remove it. To do this, go to the Creator Portal and find the island you want to unlist. Below the island name, you will see a toggle button for **Listed/Unlisted**.

After toggling to "Unlisted," your island will not appear in Discover or your creator page. You will need to do this for each of the published islands you want unlisted, as “Listed” is the default setting. Unlisted islands will not show up on your Creator Page.

### Creator Bio

The Creator Bio features your creator code, links to your social media profiles, and a description of you as a creator and the type of islands you create. You can create a custom header and profile image for your creator page as well. To edit your bio description, social media links, or add a new header image or profile image, refer to **[Manage Your Creator Page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/manage-your-creator-page-in-fortnite-creative)**.
