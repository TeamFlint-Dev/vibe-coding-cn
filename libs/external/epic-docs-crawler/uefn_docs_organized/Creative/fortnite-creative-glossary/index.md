axis

These points are called the **Left**, or **L-axis** (formerly the **Y-axis**), the **Up**, or **U-axis** (formerly the **Z-axis**), and the **Forward**, or **F-axis** (formerly the **X-axis**). Collectively, these coordinates are called **LUF**.

    Imagine you are looking over a flat plane. Place a dot in the center of the plane. This is your **0** point for all dimensions. Draw a line from north to south (away from you and toward you) and make sure it goes through the 0 point. This is **F**. Now draw a line that crosses at the 0 point, but goes east to west, (left to right). This is **L**. Draw a third line that also goes through the 0 point, crossing where the other two lines cross, but going straight up and down. This is **U**. Using those three lines, you can position any object in a three-dimensional space.

    **X-axis** and **Y-axis** are still used, but only for coordinates limited to two dimensions —   such as in reference to UI content. The X-axis refers to a location left of the origin (negative values) or right of the origin (positive values). The Y-axis refers to a location down from the origin (negative values) or up from the origin (positive values).

The open-world approach is common in [MMORPGs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#mmorpg). The world persists with or without players. Players can come and go, and have a lot more freedom in how they want to play the game. Also see [nonlinear](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#nonlinear).

orientation
:   Imagine a plane moving through the sky. Now imagine that the plane is turning right, then left. That motion of turning left or right is called **yaw**. Next, imagine the nose of the plane pointing up toward the sky or down toward the ground. This is called **pitch**. Finally, have you ever seen a stunt plane that looks like it's flying sideways, with one wing pointing up and the other down? Or even flying completely upside down? This is called **roll**. These three values control three-dimensional orientation. Compare to [axis](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#axis), which controls location in three dimensions.

For example, a minimal chain to make music includes a [note generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#notegenerator) to define what is played, an [audio generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#audiogenerator) to define how it should sound, and an output device like a [Patchwork Speaker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchworkspeaker) so it can be heard.

Think of the Note Sequencer as your sheet music — you can't directly listen to the sequence of notes on the [note grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#notegrid). You need a way to interpret the notes, such as by a musician playing it. In Patchwork, you can patch the sequencer into an [audio generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#audiogenerator) to interpret (generate) the music, then output to a [Patchwork Speaker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchworkspeaker) to play it out loud.

Think of a sequencer as the sheet music where you write your composition.

Devices connected this way make up a [device chain](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#devicechain).

By default, this setting is set to Private, which restricts access by anyone but yourself. Changing this setting can be really useful when you're collaborating with one or more other creators on an island. To provide access to other creators in your group, go to Island Settings, click the Permissions category, then change Island Edit and Copy Permission from Private to Everyone.

    2. For **UEFN,** In music, pitch is the frequency of a tone that determines how high or low, or what note it is. For example, a middle C note on a piano keyboard has a frequency (pitch) of 256 Hz, while the A above it is 440 Hz. If you move up an octave, the frequencies are doubled — the next C note has 512 Hz, while the A above that is 880 Hz.

pitch-yaw-roll
:   Pitch, yaw and roll are terms originating in aviation. They refer to the three different types of rotation a plane can perform when moving.

vertical composition
:   In [adaptive music](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#adaptivemusic), vertical composition, or reorchestration, is a technique in which a track continues to play throughout a section of a game, but as game parameters change, individual elements of the music track are added and removed.
