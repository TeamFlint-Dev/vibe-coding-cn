## Class Information

- **Grades:** 8–12 (students must be 13 or older to participate in this class)
- **Lesson timeframe:** 7–10 class periods, depending on student familiarity with Fortnite Creative
- **Featured tool:** Fortnite Creative
- **Class / learning environment:** A Fortnite-capable device with a one-to-one device-to-student ratio, and with internet connectivity. A computer lab or mobile laptop cart should provide the ideal environment.

## Lesson Overview

We've witnessed the positive impact that play can have in classrooms and communities, but can it really help all of humanity thrive?

The United Nations has [17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) consisting of must-reach targets for the year 2030. These SDGs were specifically crafted to ensure peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.

Making sure our own communities are accessible for citizens with disabilities and our growing senior citizen population is essential.

This Fortnite Creative challenge relates to [**Sustainable Development Goal 10:** Reduce Inequality within and Among Countries](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10). [**Target 10.7**](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/inequality/) within this goal focuses on facilitating orderly, safe, regular, and responsible mobility of people.

In this lesson, students will add a variety of structures on a [starter island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) using the [Fortnite Creative toolset](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), and evaluate the accessibility of these structures. They will use [design thinking](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to improve the accessibility of the structures for all people.

After students have built their inclusive and accessible residential and commercial properties, they will record a video [walkthrough](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), or capture screenshots that demonstrate their solutions.

“The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.” *– Mahatma Gandhi*

This lesson asks students to consider the following:

- How does design thinking support creative problem solving?
- How does designing and building inclusive, accessible structures improve the lives of *all* people?
- What engineering and industry innovations are needed to ensure orderly, safe, responsible mobility?

As an instructor, you can learn more about inclusive design and engineering by watching the video below.

## Learning Goals and Outcomes

Students will create an inclusive island using the Fortnite Creative toolset. As part of the process, they will:

- Learn about Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the need for responsible and effective mobility for all people.
- Apply a design thinking model to create simple solutions to a complex problem.
- Plan and develop solutions that improve accessibility and inclusion in residential and commercial structures.
- Use Fortnite Creative to present these solutions to local or global audiences.

## Activities

### 1. Introduce Students to SDG #10

Show the following videos at different points throughout the project to create excitement about the possibilities of potential solutions.

- [We The People for the Global Goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpqVmvMCmp0) featuring global celebrities
- [Understanding Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4pI2XcCHbw)
- [#InequalityIs: Tiffany Yu on inequality and disability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsAUbYd5xso)
- **SDG 10 Student Video**  (see below)

Also share these accessibility videos during the planning phase:

- [Accessibility and Inclusion for All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAxnE2XzL0k)
- [Why is Accessible Design Good for Everybody?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBSy7VrGQVU)
- [Accessible Homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpgtuut98xU)
- [Disability-Friendly Home Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2lkz2bV0po) (take a virtual tour of a real home)
- [BSI Documentary – Building Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1xgTs28vXw) (begin with the end in mind when designing)

### 2. Brainstorming and Planning a Solution

The next step is to begin brainstorming and planning an inclusive island.

1. Review Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities.
2. Have students state in their own words the exact problem that needs to be solved.
3. Brainstorm possible engineering solutions for improving mobility (such as natural or man-made adaptations, structural designs and material changes, or temporary housing).
4. Rank the list from most important to least important for improving mobility and access.
5. Discuss the [iterative design process](https://www.teachengineering.org/k12engineering/designprocess).
6. Have students make a rough sketch of their island layout.
7. Have students watch the following video for more on.

### 3. Exploration and Knowledge Application with Fortnite Creative

Now that students have done some brainstorming and planning, it's time to put that plan into action!

Students who are unfamiliar with Fortnite Creative can review Getting Started, [Playing Games](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lets-play-in-fortnite-creative), and Building Your First Island on the [Fortnite Creative Documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-documentation) site. Also use the [Fortnite Creative Glossary](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for definitions of terms.

Have the students rewatch the pause-and-play **SDG 10 Student Video** again if needed.

1. Students should begin building their [experiences](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) in Fortnite Creative using any [starter island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
2. They can use any and all of the building tools — [prefabs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), [galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), and more, found in the [Creative inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
3. Every few class periods, ask students to reflect on their work and compare it to their initial brainstorming and planning ideas. Introduce the idea of [iterative design](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to help think about the new ideas and changes they are making to their islands.

### 4. Show Off Your Work!

It's time for students to share their work with the class, and online, if they choose.

1. Building inclusive spaces requires genuine empathy. Have students discuss the difficulties they faced when redesigning their chosen structures, and how their solutions can be applied in the real world.
2. Have students create a [video walkthrough](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-thumbnails-and-videos-in-fortnite-creative) or a [slide deck](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island) to show their inclusive island. What careers and career skills are important for this specific SDG?
3. Publish the video, image captures, or demonstration on social media or another school-approved platform such as Microsoft Flipgrid.
