Did you know that in addition to playing LEGO experiences in Fortnite, you can also make your own **LEGO® Island**?

Interested? Here's where you start!

## Before You Jump In

If you're going to build your own LEGO Island, you will need to be familiar with the [LEGO® Brand and Creator Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative#rules-for-using-lego-templates). Take a minute and read through these. You will also need to sign the agreement via the Creator Portal.

Okay! Now that that's taken care of, let's move on to the fun stuff!

Would you rather watch? There's a **great video** that will get you started in about 6 minutes!

## Learn a Little LEGO Lingo

The LEGO culture has its own way of talking and this culture has found its way into Fortnite. Following are a few important words to know.

- **LEGO® Minifigure**: The player character that shows when building or playing a LEGO Island in Fortnite. Minifigures are half the size of the usual Fortnite character, so everything on a LEGO Island is scaled down to half size to match. Half the size but twice the cute!
- **LEGO Elements**: These are any of the LEGO Fortnite assets that look like they're built with real-life bricks from your LEGO sets, and are for use exclusively on LEGO Islands. This includes prefabs, devices, tools, and so on. All LEGO assets, from Minifigures to prefabricated buildings (prefabs) are scaled at half the size of Fortnite assets to match the Minifigure scale. Unlike Fortnite assets, LEGO assets cannot be scaled or resized in any way. Tiny but mighty!
- **LEGO Island**: A LEGO Island uses LEGO assets and Minifigures. Templates for these islands can be found when you interact with the console on the Creative hub, click **Create New**, and select the **LEGO® Template** tab, or in the **Project Browser** when launching UEFN. Dream big, build small!
- **Minifigure-compatible**: This can apply to props, items, tools, devices, and any other assets. It means that the asset has been scaled down to match the Minifigures used on a LEGO Island.
- **Primitives**: For a LEGO Island, primitives refers to a collection of basic geometrical shapes that look like real-life LEGO Elements. These props can be used with other elements to build just about anything you can imagine. Start simple, then build an empire!
- **Studs**: 
  The protruding cylinders on top of LEGO bricks that feature the LEGO logo.
- **Tubes**: 
  The cylindrical connectors found underneath LEGO bricks that fit between the studs to create a snap and secure fit.
- **Kragle**: 
  The sticky semi-permanent glue that binds bricks together into a static mesh you can reuse and edit. You can only use the Kragle tool when in [LEGO Brick Editor mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-the-lego-brick-editor-in-fortnite).

## Create Your Own LEGO Island

When you start a new project, you can choose a LEGO Island template to build from. These templates provide a base environment designed for LEGO gameplay and building. You can edit the landscape, add devices, and place LEGO elements and Fortnite props to shape your experience.

If you are not sure which template to start with, explore the [LEGO Templates](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-templates-in-fortnite) page for an overview of all available starter and learning templates.

After you select a template, you can customize it using the tools in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** to create your own LEGO world.

You can access the template islands from both Fortnite Creative and UEFN. Fortnite Creative provides a selection of templates, while UEFN gives you access to the full set.

### From Creative

Get to the **Creative hub** and open the **console** next to your golden rift.

1. Click **Create New**, then select the **LEGO® Templates** tab and you can see the LEGO Island templates available. Pick one!

2. Choose the island template you want to use, then click **Confirm**. If you need more info, see [Let's Play!](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lets-play-in-fortnite-creative)
3. Name your island and click **Confirm**, and there you go! The island you created will always appear in the list of islands you created.

When you go through your golden rift to reach your LEGO Island, your Fortnite character is now a **LEGO® Minifigure!**

### From Unreal Editor for Fortnite

Open UEFN and select **Create a New Project** from the Project menu on the Level Editor toolbar.
