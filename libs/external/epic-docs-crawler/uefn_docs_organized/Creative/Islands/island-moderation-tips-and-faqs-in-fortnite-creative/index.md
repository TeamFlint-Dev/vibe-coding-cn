When you submit your island for publishing from the Creator Portal, your island goes through a review process to determine whether your island complies with the [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and the [Epic Games Content Guidelines](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/content-guidelines) and either gets approved and published, or rejected. This process is called **moderation**.

Having your island rejected can be disappointing, but there are some simple steps you can take to make it more likely that your island will pass moderation the next time around.

If your island fails, you’ll receive an email with a link that opens the Creator Portal. You'll find your rejected island on the **Public Release** tab in the Creator Portal, along with the reason(s) the island failed review.

Click the information icon to open a moderation report that provides details. A failed release does not affect a currently live island, and so your last approved release remains as the current version.

Address the detailed issues, then generate a new private version before submitting the new iteration for review by creating a new public release.

## Most Common Submission Errors

When an island is disabled, it loses analytical statistics and monetization.

- Disabled islands are islands that cannot be played, opened, or playtested.
- Deleted islands are islands that are deleted from Epic’s content service.

To learn more about submission errors, see this [Fortnite blog](https://create.fortnite.com/news/common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-submitting-your-fortnite-island-for-featuring?team=personal) post, and Epic Games’ [IP and DMCA guidelines](https://create.fortnite.com/news/intellectual-property-ip-and-dmca-guidelines-for-fortnite-island-creators?team=personal).

The following is a list of the most common errors that cause an island to fail moderation.

- **Misleading Content:** This usually refers to the thumbnail you created for your island. Thumbnails must contain visual content that is true to your island experience. If your thumbnail doesn’t show real gameplay from your island, it will not pass moderation.
- **Promoting SAC:** Advertising your SAC code inside your game is strictly prohibited and will immediately cause a fail. **Do not** advertise your SAC code. Your island is not the appropriate place for self promotion. Instead, use your social media accounts to promote your islands and your SAC code.
- **Realistic Photos:** Using real images of yourself or others is not allowed in your island or for your island thumbnail. All island thumbnails in Discover **must** depict the gameplay experience of your island.
- **Profanity:** The use of offensive language in your island name, description, or media used to advertise your island is strictly prohibited and results in failed moderation. Profanity used on your island will also be flagged during moderation.

## Moderation FAQs

Below is a curated list of the most frequently asked questions when an island fails moderation.

### Why is my Fortnite Creative or UEFN project disabled?

Epic’s moderation team reviews Fortnite Creative islands at the time of submission. Epic’s moderation team may also review your island or project because it was reported by a player. If your project is disabled, it’s because content within your project violates the [Island Creator Rules & Guidelines](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) or the [Epic Games Content Guidelines](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/content-guidelines).

When you receive notification that your island failed moderation, it’s your responsibility to address any reasons your island failed moderation before resubmitting for publishing.

### Is the project locked for all members of my team?

Yes, if your project is locked, it will be inaccessible to all members of your team.

You will need to address the reasons your island failed moderation (create new promotional material, delete self-promoting material inside your island, and so on). After you've done this, you will need to generate a new link code in order to resubmit your project.

### Can I recover my project?

If you believe moderation has not been applied correctly, you have the right to appeal. Submitting an appeal is the only way to recover a project. To submit an appeal, log into the [Player Support](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/) website and use the **Contact Us** form to appeal the decision.
