**Island Settings** are the settings you can control that affect the island you're developing. These settings are available when you're in [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode) and are inaccessible [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game), with a few exceptions.

Island Settings is one of the tabs available on the **Creative menu** nav bar. From Create mode:

- Use the **M** key to open the **Creative Menu** then select the **Island Settings** tab.
- Use the **B** key to open the **Quick Menu**
  then select the Island Settings tab.

You can also press either key to **toggle back** to your island.

In addition to the toggle keys above, you can:

- Press the **Esc** key, then select **Island Settings** from the options on the right side of the screen.

## Island Settings vs. Game Settings

**Island Settings** define the rules and structure for a [game mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mode), and rounds, environments, and settings that apply to all players and objects during a game for a single island.

**Game settings** (found under the [Game Menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/exploring-the-sidebar-and-game-menu-in-fortnite-creative)) are a player's **personal settings** that affect the way that player interacts with Fortnite games as a whole, from defining graphics settings to how the player inputs information.

The primary difference between Island Settings and Game Settings is that **game developers use Island Settings** to control how players interact with the island and to establish the game rules, while **players use the Game Settings** to customize their personal experience across all islands.

## The Island Settings UI

Island Settings establish a baseline of behavior on your island, but you can override many of these settings when customizing various devices.

To customize settings for your island, make sure you're on the right tab, then select your category and subcategory.

[![From Island Settings, select a category then a subcategory.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b852d352-dc0b-411e-a453-0ee2b307edec?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b852d352-dc0b-411e-a453-0ee2b307edec?resizing_type=fit)

1. Select **Island Settings** from the menu tabs at the top of the screen.
2. Select a **category**.
3. Click a **subcategory** to show the available settings.

If you're looking for a specific setting, you can use the **search bar** to enter some or all of the setting name.

[![Use the search bar to find settings quickly.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/15b90fbf-e028-4e63-9a6b-730b31d933ef?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/15b90fbf-e028-4e63-9a6b-730b31d933ef?resizing_type=fit)

Categories with matches to the search term are indicated as shown above.

Across the bottom of the screen for all island settings is a row of buttons.

| Button | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Restore Defaults** | Click this to reset all edits you've made in the island settings back to their default values. Be aware that doing this will lose any changes you've made to any of the options. |
| **Start Game (Hold)** | Clicking and holding this button accomplishes the same thing as clicking **Start Game** on the game menu. |
| **Event Browser** | Opens the **Event Browser** — covered on the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative)page. |
| **Exit** | Return to the island. |

If you restore defaults, be aware that if the defaults for island settings have changed since the island was created, restoring defaults will update the values to the new default values, which could result in some unexpected behavior.

For example, if an island were created before the [Mantle](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) feature was added, and the default for new islands is now to have Mantle on, restoring defaults will turn on Mantle.
