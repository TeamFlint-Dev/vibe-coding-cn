Use **Primal** [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) as [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting) materials that can build up to other items. These items could be required along with another item to unlock requirements for [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

Food items include:

- **Grub**
- **Acorn**
- **Wolf Tooth**
- **Shark Tooth**
- **Raptor Eye**

*Use the devices like Conditional Button and Item Spawner to create the system of crafting.*

You could pair items like **Raptor Eyes** and **Grubs** as materials needed to craft weapons or other items like **[Stink Sacs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)**.

To do this, you would need to set the Conditional Button setting **Key Items Required** to **2** and pair the device with an [**Item Granter**](using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to grant the usable item.

You can also blend items with [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) of similar [themes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) from the **Galleries** and **Prefabs** tabs.

[![Blending Primal Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a3ab5213-05db-49c2-a165-6ca0aa4031da?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a3ab5213-05db-49c2-a165-6ca0aa4031da?resizing_type=fit)

*This Galleries prop can be found in Monster Skull Gallery.*

For example, you can blend food with fridges and stoves for an immersive gameplay.

To create the process of crafting, you will need to either [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) the item onto your map with the Item Spawner or [grant](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grant) items to players through the Item Granter.

Players can collect these items to exchange for usable items through devices like Conditional Button, which consumes equipped items. They can also use these items to craft other items that will build up to a larger item.

## Finding and Placing Items

[![Finding Primal Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5fd9f453-bed5-4f64-bd82-10d086e30b4b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5fd9f453-bed5-4f64-bd82-10d086e30b4b?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

1. From **Create mode**, press the **Tab** key and click **Creative** to select the [Creative inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen.
2. Click the **Items** tab.
3. On this screen, scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then either choose **Equip** or **Add To Chest**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resources-bar). When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**.

You may want to create an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting Add To Chest will add the item to the [Chest tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Each time you click it, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the Chest tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the Chest tab. When it’s full, the Add To Chest tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the Chest tab.

From the Chest tab, you can select either Create Chest or Create Llama to store the items in a Chest or a Llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).

## Managing Items

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the **Play** inventory screen, you can split item stacks or remove them entirely from the Resources bar.

[![Primal Resources Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e65f2f82-b38e-46e1-baf8-43522514f8d9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e65f2f82-b38e-46e1-baf8-43522514f8d9?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Registering Crafting Items to a Device

[![Pairing Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c934659-5a9f-4869-906f-1b145b66ee2f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7c934659-5a9f-4869-906f-1b145b66ee2f?resizing_type=fit)

You can drop items directly onto devices that can either hold or grant items. Above shows the Conditional Button, which holds two crafting items and an Item Spawner that holds one usable item.

This pair of devices can be set up for players to exchange Wheat and Roasted Chicken for Meat. To do so, these items must first be [registered](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) to the devices that will hold the information.

[![Registering Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/48fba3da-d32f-4e79-99f6-da791e828655?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/48fba3da-d32f-4e79-99f6-da791e828655?resizing_type=fit)

To register items to a device, you must stand directly on or immediately beside the device.

To register an item for this kind of device, follow these steps.

1. In the Creative inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **Play** inventory screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item.

Compatible devices that can hold items are:

- **Vending Machine**
- **Team Settings & Inventory**
- **Class Designer**
- **Capture Item Spawner**
- **Item Granter**
- **Item Spawner**
- **Conditional Button**
- **Elimination Manager**
- **Item Remover**

Use these devices to set up your own system for granting and spawning items onto your island.
