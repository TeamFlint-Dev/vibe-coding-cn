## Class Information

- **Grades:** 8–12 (students must be 13 or older to participate in this class)
- **Lesson timeframe:** 7–10 class periods, depending on student familiarity with Fortnite Creative
- **Featured tool:** Fortnite Creative
- **Class / learning environment:** A Fortnite-capable device with a one-to-one device-to-student ratio, and with internet connectivity. A computer lab or mobile laptop cart should provide the ideal environment.

## Lesson Overview

This challenge relates to [Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal8). Sustainable tourism that lifts the local populations out of poverty is more important now than ever, and this issue impacts every country.

In this lesson, students will turn a series of archipelago islands inhabited by locals into the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT) Getaway — a tourist destination like no other. Students will design unforgettable experiences that draw tourists from around the globe and grow the local island economy.

Visitors can be offered the opportunity to stay the night in authentic island housing. Island space is limited, so students are encouraged to incorporate the ocean into the design where possible. One island should be used for the local population's living space.

*One GOAT Getaway solution uses Wood Shanty Stilt Houses in the resort area to preserve a local beach area and provide authentic local accommodations, (2) a Fortnite launch-pad "diving board", and (3) a village on a nearby island for the local residents.*

This lesson asks students to consider the following:

- How does the [design thinking](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#design-thinking) process support creative problem solving?
- How can tourism lift locals out of poverty?
- What are some disadvantages to bringing tourists into your world?
- What tourist accommodations and experiences can create sustainable, poverty-reducing tourism?

As an instructor, you can learn more about GOAT Getaway by watching the video below.

## Learning Goals and Outcomes

Students will create an island getaway solution using Fortnite Creative. As part of the process, they will:

- Learn about Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.
- Demonstrate an understanding of tourism and how it can benefit (or harm) a local economy.
- Apply a design thinking model to come up with a simple solution to this complex problem.
- Plan, engineer, and develop a solution to provide decent work and economic growth.
- Communicate this solution using Fortnite Creative, and share it with a local or global audience.

## Activities

### 1. Introduce Students to SDG #8

Show the following videos to create excitement about what's possible. These can be shown at different points throughout the project.

- [We The People for the Global Goals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpqVmvMCmp0) featuring global celebrities
- [Understanding Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVBypZdv8qw)
- **SDG 8 Student Video**  (see below)

### 2. Brainstorming and Planning a Solution

The next step is to begin the planning and brainstorming process for the getaway. Students can do this using the handout provided, and a pen or pencil and paper to sketch out what their island would look like.

1. Review Sustainable Development Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.
2. In their own words, state the exact problem that needs to be solved.
3. Brainstorm a list of what tourists would want to experience on the Greatest Of All Time (GOAT) Getaway.
4. Rank the list from most important to least important for this specific getaway.
5. Brainstorm possible engineering methods to transform natural islands and the water’s surface into an experience that the world would want to visit. Remember to plan for trees and water views, and buildings for local staff use only.
6. Discuss the [iterative design process](https://www.teachengineering.org/k12engineering/designprocess).
7. Use the handout to help plan their GOAT Getaway based on the points above.

Consider accounting for transportation, guests with disabilitities, and activities that would appeal to tourists. Use [prefabs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prefab) that can be found in the [CREATIVE inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) under the [PREFABS tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Feel free to landscape the island by removing trees and planting them elsewhere if needed. Find purposes for your valuable water sources.

*These GOAT Getaway modifications include (1) an airport for air arrivals and departures, (2) a whale-watching tower, (3) land transportation, and (4) docking for ocean arrivals and departures.*

### 3. Exploration and Knowledge Application with Fortnite Creative

Now that students have done some planning and brainstorming, it's time to put that plan into action!

Students who are unfamiliar with Fortnite Creative can review Getting Started, [Playing Games](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lets-play-in-fortnite-creative), and Building Your First Island on the [Fortnite Creative Documentation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-documentation) site. Also use the [Fortnite Creative Glossary](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for definitions of terms.

1. Students should begin building their getaway experiences in Fortnite Creative using the Archipelagos Island or XL Archipelagos Island (for multiple students collaborating on a single island) found under [Starter Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#starter-island).
2. They can use any and all of the building tools — prefabs, galleries, devices, and more, found in the Creative inventory.
3. Every few class periods, ask students to reflect on their work and compare it to their initial brainstorming and planning ideas. Introduce the idea of [iterative design](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#iterate) to help think about the new ideas and changes they are making to their islands.

### 4. Show off your work!

It's time for students to share their work with the class, and online, if they choose.

1. Create a [video walkthrough](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-thumbnails-and-videos-in-fortnite-creative) or an [image-capture slide deck](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island) to show your island to the class.
2. Reflect on some ways that you could generate tourism locally that would help boost the economy. What careers and career skills are important for this specific SDG?
3. Publish your video, image captures, or demonstration on social media or another school-approved platform such as Microsoft Flipgrid.

Consider using the following hashtags on Twitter and Instagram to help promote and share your island: #EpicGames #FortniteCreative #EpicSDGs #TeachSDGs
