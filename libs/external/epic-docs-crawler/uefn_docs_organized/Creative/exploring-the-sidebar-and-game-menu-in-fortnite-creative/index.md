The **sidebar** is the menu that pops out from the right when you press the **Esc** key. You can access the sidebar across all Fortnite [game genres](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-genre) (Save the World, Battle Royale, Creative and so on), although the choices listed in the sidebar may differ, depending on which genre you are in, and where in a game or [experience](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#experience) you are.

Press the **Esc key** to open the sidebar and you'll see that it includes many different sections.

- Find your **Profile** options by clicking your character portrait and the top left of the panel.
- The **Social** options are displayed when you click one of four icons at the top of the left navigation bar on the panel: **Party Up**, **Add Friends**, **Looking for Party**, and **Voice Chat**. By default, the panel opens with the **Party Up** options displayed.
- Open the **Game Menu** by clicking the **gear** (**Menu**) icon above the **red arrow** (**Exit**) icon.
- Return to the lobby or close Fortnite by clicking the **red arrow** (**Exit**) icon.
