The **pre-game lobby** is where players initially spawn as they wait to join games. Use pre-game lobbies as a dedicated space for players to learn game rules while [matchmaking](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

Design lobbies to communicate game rules by using informational devices like [**Billboard**](using-billboard-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [Pop-Up Dialog](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-popup-dialog-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

## Building Your Lobby

Browse the [Prefab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and [Gallery](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) tabs and consider a [theme](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for your pre-game lobby.

Use items from the **PreFab** tab if you want to use a pre-built structure, complete with props and decorations.

Use items from the **Gallery** tab if you want to build a unique pre-game lobby, putting pieces together on your own. Challenge yourself by mixing pieces from different galleries.

Build structures that are at least two tiles high, with a floor and a roof.

For a faster [build](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#build), press **B** to open the **Options** panel ([Quick Menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#quick-menu)). Locate and set **Building to Prop** to **Off**.

Follow the steps below to create a pre-game structure.

1. Press the **Tab** key to open the [Creative inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
2. From the **Prefabs** or **Galleries** tab, select your floor piece, then click **PLACE NOW**.
3. Press **V** until the **Grid Snap** option is 2. By setting [grid snap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid-snap) to 2, the pieces will automatically align to the island’s [grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid) for easier placement.
4. Place your floor pieces to create the pre-game lobby's foundation.

Make the pre-game lobby large enough to hold the maximum number of players for your game.

### Designer Tips

Offer players a fun environment while they wait. As shown in the photo above, this lobby offers a winding bookcase that players can hop on.

Once the pre-game lobby structure is complete, begin adding devices like [Player Spawn Pads](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

Check out [**Building Arenas**](building-arenas-in-fortnite-creative) to create structures for players to battle, like in [Pinbrawl](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/pinbrawl-island-tutorial-in-fortnite-creative).
