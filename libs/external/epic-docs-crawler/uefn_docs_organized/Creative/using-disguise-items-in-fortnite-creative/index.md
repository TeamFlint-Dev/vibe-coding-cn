## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange one item or group of items for another.

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require [**Flower Petals**](/documentation/404) and [**Fibrous Herbs**](/documentation/404) as items needed to craft a **Bush**.
