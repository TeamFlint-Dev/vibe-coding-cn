Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange one item or group of items for another.

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **[Hop Drop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-halloween-candy-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Blast Powder](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-power-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft a **Shockwave Grenade**.
