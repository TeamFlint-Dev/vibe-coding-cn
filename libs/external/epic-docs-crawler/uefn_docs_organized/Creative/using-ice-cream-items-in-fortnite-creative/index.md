4. Click the item, then click either **EQUIP** or **ADD TO CHEST**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). When you're back in Create mode, you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) by pressing the **F** key.

Chests and llamas are a great way to offer item bundles to players. Selecting **Add To Chest** adds the item to the **Chest** tab. Each time you click **Add To Chest**, the item count will increase by one, shown as a yellow box on the **Chest** tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** button will disappear. You must remove items from the **Chest** tab to add more.

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange one item or group of items for another.

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **[Peppers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-produce-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Bandages](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-healing-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft a **Spicy Icecream Cone**.
