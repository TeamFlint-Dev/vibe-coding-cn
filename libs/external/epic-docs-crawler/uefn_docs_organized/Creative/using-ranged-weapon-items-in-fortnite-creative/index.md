## Using Items for Crafting

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require a **[Stink Sac](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Blast Powder](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-power-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft a **Stink Bomb**.
