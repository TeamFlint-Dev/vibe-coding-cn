The **Creator Portal** provides a way for you to form collaborative teams of developers and creators that can work together on shared projects in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**.

With the **UEFN teams feature**, you can set clear roles and responsibilities, have different team members working on different features at the same time, and track changes and versions for shared projects.

These collaborative UEFN projects can also be published through the Creator Portal.

## Setting Up Teams and Assigning Roles

Team roles have different functions and responsibilities. Team members can have different roles, depending on the project, so assign roles based on each one’s strengths and the permissions you want to grant them.

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Owner** | Controls all team branding, [branding profiles](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#brand), and monetization. The owner can also assign team members, view projects and project links, create new project versions, edit project metadata, submit project metadata for moderation, transfer project ownership, and promote and demote admins. The owner is also the person who sets up the team, and will remain as owner unless they transfer ownership to another team member. |
| **Administrator** | Can view projects and project links, and can create new project versions, edit project metadata, submit project metadata for moderation, and promote and demote admins. |
| **Publisher** | Can publish and manage projects, view projects and project links, create new project versions, and submit project metadata for moderation. |
| **Collaborator** | Can view projects and project links, create new project versions, and edit project metadata. |

A team can have a maximum of 30 members. If you try to exceed that number, you'll get a message:

[![team full message](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ae1b0e4d-67e7-4c0f-ab76-21f376d2378e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ae1b0e4d-67e7-4c0f-ab76-21f376d2378e?resizing_type=fit)

Before you invite others to a team, you will go through an age verification process that includes providing the email address you use with your Epic account.

You must be over 18 to invite other creators and developers to a team, or to accept an invite to join another team.
