Jump into Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite to build LEGO® Islands using special templates, LEGO bricks, and [LEGO Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary)! Working with LEGO assets and islands comes with certain responsibilities and expectations. Below are a series of guidelines for creating LEGO Islands.

Before you start, it helps to understand:

- The rules for working on a LEGO Island
- How monetization is different from other Fortnite islands
- How to sign up to access LEGO Islands
- Appropriate ways to work with LEGO Elements
- Media guidelines for promoting your LEGO Islands

- [LEGO® Asset Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-asset-inventory-in-fortnite-creative)

To get started building your own LEGO Islands, you first need to enroll in the **Island Creator Program** in [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/island-creator).

## Rules for Using LEGO Templates

In order to build with LEGO templates, there are rules you need to follow, in addition to the [**Fortnite Island Creator Rules**](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and existing agreements. These rules are detailed below:

- [LEGO Brand Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative#lego-brand-rules)
- [Restrictions against third-party IP](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative#never-use-lego-assets-with-third-party-ip)
- [IARC Rating Restrictions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative#iarc-audience-restrictions)

Refer to the rules outlined below to make sure your island is compliant.

### LEGO Brand Rules

When building using LEGO templates, LEGO Elements, LEGO bricks or any other LEGO content, you must adhere to the following rules or you could risk experiencing the consequences above.

1. **No modification.** Do not change or otherwise modify the shape of any existing LEGO brick, element or other LEGO content, for example, by stretching, cropping or recoloring (unless available from a list of color presets) elements.
2. **Don’t sell or redistribute any LEGO Elements.** You cannot sell, license or distribute any stand-alone LEGO Elements or assets or as part of an online asset database or marketplace, or any other database including, in such a way that would allow a third party to use, download, extract, or access any LEGO assets as a stand-alone file.
3. **Keep things fun - don’t advertise, preach or campaign.** Do not advertise or promote any products or services or preach about sensitive topics, like political parties or religion.
4. **No trademark use.** You cannot use any LEGO Group trademarks in an island name or description in a way that implies that The LEGO Group created your island. LEGO trademarks, include but are not limited to the following:

   - LEGO
   - BrickHeadz
   - DOTS
   - DREAMZzz
   - DUPLO
   - Minifigure
   - Monkie Kid
   - NINJAGO
   - TECHNIC
   - NEXO KNIGHTS
   - CHIMA
   - LEGENDS OF CHIMA
   - BIONICLE
   - SCALA
   - OCTAN
   - HIDDEN SIDE
   - VIDIYO
   - BRICKLINK
   - MINDSTORMS
   - SPIKE
5. **The LEGO Group owns all rights in its bricks, elements, sets and toys, or other LEGO content.** The LEGO Group owns and retains all rights and title in all LEGO content, including all copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Your permitted use of any LEGO content in an Island does not grant you any ownership rights in any LEGO content.
6. **No recreation of existing LEGO® sets and LEGO® toys.** You cannot use any LEGO content, including LEGO® bricks and LEGO Elements, within Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor to recreate or publish any Fortnite Islands which feature LEGO® sets and LEGO® toys (whether such LEGO® sets and LEGO® toys have already been released by the LEGO Group, or announced but not yet released by the LEGO Group). This also includes any creations and submissions available on the LEGO® Ideas site, and any LEGO® sets available on the LEGO BrickLink site.
7. **Only create using genuine LEGO® bricks and LEGO Elements.** You can only use the available tools to create assets that look like they are built with genuine, real-life LEGO® bricks or LEGO Elements. You are therefore not permitted to create your own version of a LEGO® brick or LEGO Element, or recreate any non-genuine LEGO® brick or LEGO Element.

The LEGO Brand Rules are enforced by Epic and The LEGO Group. The LEGO Group can report your island to Epic for violating their rules.

If the LEGO Group reports your island to Epic for violating their Brand Rules, your content will be removed, and you will not be eligible for engagement payout awards for that island. If you repeatedly violate the LEGO Brand Rules, you will lose access to the LEGO templates. Continued violation of these rules may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

### Never Use LEGO Assets with Third-Party IP

LEGO Islands are already set up with brand-appropriate LEGO Elements and assets you are allowed to use as part of the agreement. The IP Partner Licensing agreement makes clear that you cannot mix LEGO assets with other third-party Intellectual Property (IP), even if the owner of the IP has given their approval. Of course, you can import and use assets that you own all the rights to if they are compliant with the LEGO Brand Rules listed above.

You can also use IP Program Assets or assets provided to you directly by Epic Games. But if you create an island using IP Program Assets and include any other third-party materials, your island may not be eligible for engagement payout awards and may be removed from the ecosystem or disabled. Continued violation of this rule may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

### IARC Audience Restrictions

Any LEGO Islands that you create will need to have an age-appropriate rating. The LEGO Island templates and Creator Portal are set up to guide you through this process. As a general rule, create your island with all audiences in mind.

The table below shows each Rating Authority, region, and age-appropriate rating for a LEGO Island.

| Rating Authority | Region | Maximum Age Rating Category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ESRB](https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/) | North America | E 10+ |
| [PEGI](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean) | Europe & UK | PEGI 7 |
| [ACB](https://www.classification.gov.au/classification-ratings/what-do-ratings-mean) | Australia | PG |
| [Classlnd](https://www.gov.br/mj/pt-br/assuntos/seus-direitos/classificacao-1) | Brazil | 10 |
| [USK](https://usk.de/die-usk-alterskennzeichen/) | Germany | 12 |
| [GRAC](https://www.grac.or.kr/english/) | South Korea | 12+ |
| Russia | Russia | 12+ |
| [IARC General](https://www.globalratings.com/ratings-guide.aspx) | Rest of World | IARC 7+ |

## Monetizing LEGO Islands

The LEGO Group is providing a limited license to their content for you to use their approved assets. This will let you bring the magic of building with LEGO Elements into the Fortnite ecosystem, and create new types of islands for the Fortnite community. In return, you must comply with all of Fortnite’s Island Creator Policies and Content Guidelines and Commercial Policies, in addition to the LEGO Brand Rules described above. The only approved LEGO assets and features are the ones accessed through the designated templates.

In exchange for creating LEGO Islands, you agree to share 15% of your total island payout with The LEGO Group. Epic will automatically deduct this amount from your engagement payout and distribute it to The LEGO Group, and you will receive the remainder. You agree to this process when you sign the IP Partner Licensing Agreement.

You can only monetize the provided LEGO content within Fortnite.

[In-island transactions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-in-fortnite) are currently not supported by this IP.

## Working with LEGO Elements

Build the LEGO Island of your dreams with unique templates that contain LEGO Elements, including prefabs, galleries, tools, and items. For example, there are fun and colorful creatures in the desert of [Music Concert](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/build-your-own-lego-music-concert-in-fortnite-creative), and classic colored brick-inspired props to create a challenging [obstacle course](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/build-your-own-lego-obstacle-course-in-fortnite-creative).

[![obstacle course LEGO template](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/666083a4-36ab-4e72-afe9-2178fad23469?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/666083a4-36ab-4e72-afe9-2178fad23469?resizing_type=fit)

You can mix these assets with the available Fortnite devices to build fun and imaginative island experiences! To learn more about all the LEGO Elements available in LEGO templates, see [LEGO® Assets Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-asset-inventory-in-fortnite-creative). Remember to follow the LEGO Brand Rules, of course!

To learn more about how LEGO templates differ from other Fortnite islands, see [Working with LEGO® Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-lego-islands-in-fortnite-creative).

## Promoting Your LEGO Island

When creating media for your island, refer to the guidelines outlined in [Promoting Your Fortnite Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island). Make sure images and videos accurately reflect the island or game mechanics you created and don’t reflect another game type or copy another creator.

### Thumbnails, Lobby Background Images, and Videos

In addition to the existing rules, you may have noticed that some of the LEGO Brand Rules also relate to your promotional assets. Here are some specific guidelines on the LEGO Brand Rules for your promotional materials.

You **can**:

- Use Minifigures in your thumbnails.
- Show LEGO assets in your thumbnails and lobby backgrounds as long as they follow the existing guidelines.

You **cannot**:

- Use the LEGO wordmark or The LEGO Group trademarks in your island title. See LEGO Brand Rules for the list of trademarks.
- Use the LEGO wordmark or The LEGO Group trademarks in your island description. See LEGO Brand Rules for the list of trademarks.
- Use third-party IP in your island's thumbnail, even if that IP has an existing LEGO style in Fortnite.

### Your Island in Discover

In the Creator Portal, LEGO Islands are automatically tagged with "LEGO Island" during the publishing process for a special tag that will appear in the product details page.

Creator-made LEGO Islands will show up in Discover and are searchable, like any other Fortnite island.
