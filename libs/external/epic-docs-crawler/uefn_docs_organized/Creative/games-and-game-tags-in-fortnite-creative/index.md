A **game genre** is a specific kind of game experience. Examples of genres would be [real-time strategy](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or [first-person shooter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) games.

A genre is informed in part by **camera** and **character**.
For example, a first-person shooter camera is from the shooter's viewpoint, and the player sees what the shooter sees. In real-time strategy, the camera is outside of the game so the player can see the whole playing field. A third-person action game like Fortnite Battle Royale lets players see their own characters as well as other characters in the game.

A collection of similar game genres makes up a **category** of games.

## Using Game Tags to Describe Your Island

One practical use of understanding the types of games that make up a genre or category is learning how to apply the right **tags** when you're publishing your island.

For more on publishing, see [Publishing from the Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) and [Publishing Projects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/publishing-projects-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

Game tags can describe **gameplay**, or they can describe some aspect of the game's appearance or [theme](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
