In front of the player are two buttons on a wall. The first button spawns a hoard of creatures that start running towards them. The player eliminates all the creatures and goes back to the wall and presses the second button, a new wave of different creatures comes running towards them.

The Spawn 123 gameplay example teaches you different ways to configure the Creature Spawner device to create waves of enemies in your experience with the use of three [Creature Spawners](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#creature-spawner), a [Creature Placer device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#creature-placer), [Button devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#button), a [Timed Objective device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#timed-objective), and the Team Settings & Inventory device.
