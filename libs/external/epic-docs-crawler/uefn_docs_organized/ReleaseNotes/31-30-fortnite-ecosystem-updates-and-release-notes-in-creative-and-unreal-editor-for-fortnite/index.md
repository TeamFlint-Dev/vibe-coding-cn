Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) have landed in UEFN and Fortnite Creative with v31.30, create your very own TMNT islands with a brand new set of tools, content and templates. You can also check out an experimental release of First Person Camera and if you’re creating a LEGO® Island, take off to the dark side of the moon with the Scary Space template. And that’s not all, the new Creator Marketing Playbook is now available, filled with tips and tricks for finding and growing an audience on Fortnite.

## Update on Feature Release Strategy

We're making a change to improve your experience with UEFN and Creative! We're making it more stable and reducing the disruptions that both you and your players have encountered in the past. Starting with v32.00, most new features will be rolled out in major (.00) releases — so the next big update will be 32.00. This change allows us to deliver higher-quality, well-tested releases, while smaller updates (.10, .20, etc.) will focus on bug fixes and performance improvements. Of course, there may be exceptions, especially around events like Unreal Fest!

## Build Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) Islands in Fortnite

You can now build Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) islands for Fortnite using UEFN and Fortnite Creative. This update gives you access to templates, weapons, devices, and NPCs straight from the sewers of New York City (NYC)!

To **publish** your mean, green TMNT islands, you’ll need to opt into additional terms and conditions in the [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome) that confirm you’ll agree to share 15% of your engagement payout for TMNT islands with Paramount Pictures (see [fee schedule](https://create.fortnite.com/news/ip-partner-fee-schedule)). If you’ve already opted into the terms and conditions to publish LEGO® islands, you don’t need to re-sign. You’ll also need to make sure your island adheres to the [TMNT Brand and Creator Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative).

Features are made available in an Experimental state so you can test them out, provide feedback, and see what we’re planning. Please keep in mind that we do not guarantee backward compatibility for assets created at the Experimental stage. Also, the APIs for Experimental features are subject to change and we may remove Experimental features (or specific functionality of them) at our discretion.

[![Scary Space template in UEFN.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bdc6fc46-d9cc-45d8-9af8-f20e96ee1be2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bdc6fc46-d9cc-45d8-9af8-f20e96ee1be2?resizing_type=fit)

## LEGO Assets and More!

### New Galleries

[![Scary Space External Galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9e499c5f-754e-4696-b1d8-f87dd24f5f56?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9e499c5f-754e-4696-b1d8-f87dd24f5f56?resizing_type=fit)

- Space Gallery Updates

  - These galleries have been improved with updates to their hologram previews, boundary lines, bounding boxes, resource type assignments, and more!
  - With these changes, the Space Gallery assets now exit "early access".

### New Prefabs

[![LEGO Space prefabs](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5bb74a6-db56-4330-8cfd-015469982b76?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5bb74a6-db56-4330-8cfd-015469982b76?resizing_type=fit)

- Space Prefabs Released!

  - As promised, the prefabs that correlate to the Space Galleries from 31.00 are now available.. Build your own space station or Moon base!

### New LEGO Minifigure Spawner

- LEGO Minifigure NPC Assets for NPC Spawner

  - 8 additional Minifigure NPC variants have been made available for use with the NPC Spawner device, including scary variants to celebrate the release of the Scary Space content!

### New Minifigure Movement

- Dodge Roll and Mantling have entered the chat!

  - Enable Dodge Roll in Island Settings and roll around the map, dodging whatever comes your way!
  - Mantling is now also available in Island Settings for LEGO Islands. Let’s go! Up and over!

Some assets in the Content tab or Content Browser may not be available for a certain brand. This is because islands created with an external brand should reflect the vibe, tone, and idea behind the brand. For example, Fall Guys beans are cute and playful--it's never appropriate for them to use weapons because that does not align with the Fall Guys brand. Similarly, not all of the Fortnite assets are available in LEGO® Islands because they are not Minifigure-compatible (Minifigures do have small hands, after all).

Make sure to check out each brand's introduction blog post and the accompanying documentation so you get the full understanding of what is (and isn't) okay within a specific brand and why.

## New Ascender Device

Creators now have access to the [Ascender Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/using-ascender-devices-in-fortnite-creative) from Battle Royale. Use this vertical zipline to add quick traversal on your islands with vertical design! The Ascender device has three versions: Ground, Wall, and Cable. The cable auto-adjusts to the desired height between the ground and its placement unless the Max Cable Length is reached first.

The device also uses the Enable and Disable functions for unique gameplay!

## Out Now! Reporting Unoriginal Promotional Assets

Creators can now use the new **Report Unoriginal Promotional Assets** tool in Creator Portal to report islands that have a thumbnail, title or description that duplicates or is very similar to their own original creations.

Reports will be carefully reviewed, and when creators are found violating ‘[Fortnite Island Creator Rule 1.6: Be Original](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules)’, they will be subject to immediate monetization penalties, with more significant consequences for repeat offenses, including permanent account bans.

This policy only applies to content originally created for the Fortnite Ecosystem. Only team owners can report violations or appeal rulings against their islands, and reports cannot be submitted on behalf of other creators. The form to submit a report is located in the new Support section of Creator Portal.
