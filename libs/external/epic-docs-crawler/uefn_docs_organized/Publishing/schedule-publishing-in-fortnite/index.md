Creator Portal has the tools you need to schedule the publish date for your islands. Choose the day and exact time your island goes live to align with marketing campaigns or global audiences. Manage the scheduling for a brand new, existing, or older release of your islands.

In Creator Portal, scheduling your releases means you can:

- Schedule a brand new island to go live at a set time in the future within 1-90 days.
- Schedule the publish date of a previously approved, unpublished release.
- Manage releases to go live on your own time.

Just set a date and your island publishes automatically. Scheduling is built into the established [publishing workflow](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) to afford you greater control over publishing your island even before it goes through the review process.

## Scheduling a Publish

When you reach the **Visibility** portion of the publishing workflow, you have three options:

- **Automatically Publish**
- **Automatically Publish on a Scheduled Date and Time**
- **Manually Publish Later**

[![You can schedule the publish of your islands from the Visibility settings of the publish flow.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5bd8cf2-96d4-4da7-8952-b3a67ab80557?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5bd8cf2-96d4-4da7-8952-b3a67ab80557?resizing_type=fit)

Check the **Marketing and Promotion** box to feature your island in Epic Games promotions or for promotional social media purposes. This grants Epic Games the right to promote your island on your behalf.

### Automatically Publish

**Automatically Publish** follows the established publishing path set out in the [Publish from the Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) document.

Selecting Automatically Publish means that once your island has been reviewed and approved it will automatically publish with the visibility state you selected. Setting your island to **Listed** means players can find your island through its [island code](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#island-code), search, [creator pages](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creator-pages-in-fortnite-creative), and [Discover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/how-discover-works-in-fortnite). Islands set to **Unlisted** can only be found by their island code.

[![Select the visibility setting for your island's published state.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ca36ff68-36d4-4f6a-af3e-f8ea52c61f76?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ca36ff68-36d4-4f6a-af3e-f8ea52c61f76?resizing_type=fit)

### Automatically Publish on a Scheduled Date and Time

Setting your island to publish on a set day and time means your island publishes to the visibility state you set on the day and time you schedule.

[![Select a publishing schedule for your island by selecting a day, time, and visibility setting.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4e496273-33c2-4845-8f38-ae517db36e10?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4e496273-33c2-4845-8f38-ae517db36e10?resizing_type=fit)

To publish your island on a specific day and time, do the following:

1. Select the **date** from the calendar.
2. Enter the **time of day** your island will publish.
3. Select the **visibility state** of your island when it publishes.
4. Click **Submit for Review** to send your island into the review process.

Scheduling a brand new publish requires a **24 hour** buffer from time of publishing to ensure that the island will be moderated. Once approved, you may modify the schedule at least 30 mins into the future.

You cannot schedule a publication more than 90 days into the future.

Once you’ve scheduled a publish window for your island, it appears on the Publishing page under the **Release tab** with all the scheduling details.

[![The island is listed under Unpublished with the publishing schedule attached below.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/284116b4-6227-4917-bf6c-61e63721108d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/284116b4-6227-4917-bf6c-61e63721108d?resizing_type=fit)

### Manually Publish Later

When you decide to publish manually, your island sits in the **Unpublished list** of the Releases tab and goes through the review process, but does not get published if the review is approved.

[![Publish a new island or an island version from the Unpublished list by selecting the Schedule publish option from the additional options menu.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c18a2c14-85af-49ba-8c72-b4c0eb145429?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c18a2c14-85af-49ba-8c72-b4c0eb145429?resizing_type=fit)

When you’re ready to publish, do the following:

1. Expand the **additional options menu** and select **Schedule publish** from the dropdown menu.
2. Select the **date** from the calendar.
3. Enter the **time of day** your island will publish.
4. Select the **visibility state** of your island when it publishes.

Afterward, scheduling information is added to your unpublished island version in the Unpublished list.

If you select **Publish Now** from the dropdown menu, a popup opens with the visibility choices for your island. Select a visibility option for your island and it publishes.

[![When selecting Publish Now, you'll need to select a visibility state before the island can publish.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0880a237-0336-400a-ab35-77465df82a36?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0880a237-0336-400a-ab35-77465df82a36?resizing_type=fit)

## Edit a Scheduled Publish

After selecting a publishing schedule for your island, you can edit the schedule at any time. Edit the publishing schedule by doing the following:

1. Click the **pencil icon** on the schedule information bar, an Edit publish schedule popup opens.

   [![You can edit the publish schedule any time by clicking the pen icon in the schedule field and selecting a new date and time for the island to publish.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/59931bd2-a4b5-440e-8f28-74d56cca0659?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/59931bd2-a4b5-440e-8f28-74d56cca0659?resizing_type=fit)
2. Select a new **Visibility**.
3. Select a **new date** from the calendar.
4. Enter a **new publish time** of day.
5. Click **Save Schedule** to complete the editing process.

   [![Edit a schedule by entering new scheduling information into the Edit publish schedule popup.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5bbe295-9e6f-452b-b76b-f29e8e194154?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e5bbe295-9e6f-452b-b76b-f29e8e194154?resizing_type=fit)

   Click to enlarge image.

The island‘s scheduling information updates in the Unpublished list.

## Delete Schedule

If the publishing schedule you created for your island doesn’t work, or if the island needs further development, you can delete a scheduled publish. To delete a scheduled publish, do the following:

1. Click the **garbage bin icon** on the schedule information bar. A confirmation popup opens.

   [![Click the garbage icon to start the deletion process.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6a75b786-fef9-4790-a367-ddfb78e8d6a3?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6a75b786-fef9-4790-a367-ddfb78e8d6a3?resizing_type=fit)
2. Click **Delete Schedule** to confirm deletion of the schedule.

   [![Confirm the deleted schedule by clicking Delete Schedule.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c99a1ae8-5e86-49a2-8630-c6c6f96a36ab?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c99a1ae8-5e86-49a2-8630-c6c6f96a36ab?resizing_type=fit)

   Click to enlarge image.

   All scheduling information is removed from the island in the Unpublished list.

   [![Once you confirm to delete the schedule from the island or island version, the scheduling information is removed.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/04376697-cb44-476b-8626-c226ae402211?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/04376697-cb44-476b-8626-c226ae402211?resizing_type=fit)

## Schedule Publishing from the Release List

You can schedule a publishing event for an approved, unpublished island in the Unpublished list. This works the same as selecting to manually publish an island. Click the **additional options menu** to begin the scheduling process. For steps to scheduling a publish from the Release list, see the **Manually Publish** section above.

## Override a Schedule from the Release List

You can override the publishing schedule of an approved, unpublished island that is currently scheduled to publish by releasing another approved version of the island instead. To override the publishing schedule of an island version, follow these steps:

1. Click the **additional options menu** on another island version and select **Publish Now**. A confirmation popup opens.

   [![To override a scheduled publish, select Publish Now on another approved island version from the Unpublished list.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/66aab7b1-e303-4916-b573-04a84963351f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/66aab7b1-e303-4916-b573-04a84963351f?resizing_type=fit)

   The popup contains all the release information on the scheduled island version, and informs you that by clicking Publish Now, you cancel the scheduled release of the other version.
2. Click **Publish Now**.

   [![Select a visibility state for the island you are about to publish.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d72feca9-ed43-4335-b8a6-4f7e0d5e31fb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d72feca9-ed43-4335-b8a6-4f7e0d5e31fb?resizing_type=fit)

   Click to enlarge image.

   The island version publishes immediately.

   [![The overridden island has its publishing schedule removed, and the current published version updates to the island version you selected to publish now.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cdba9f32-578c-4a25-b7d6-59c4f5dc5d2b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cdba9f32-578c-4a25-b7d6-59c4f5dc5d2b?resizing_type=fit)
