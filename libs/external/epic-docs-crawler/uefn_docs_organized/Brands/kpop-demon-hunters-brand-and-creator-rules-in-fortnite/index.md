## Rules for Using KPop Demon Hunters Templates

In order to build with KPop Demon Hunters templates, there are rules you need to follow in addition to the [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules)  and other existing agreements such as the Monetization Agreement.

### The KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules

When building using KPop Demon Hunters templates and promoting your islands that use KPop Demon Hunters templates, you must adhere to the Fortnite Island Creator Rules and all other relevant agreements and the following rules or you will be subject to the enforcement actions, including those discussed below.

1. **L****imits to KPop Demon Hunters Characters.** You may only use the KPop Demon Hunters characters officially provided to you in UEFN. Do not import any other KPop Demon Hunters-related characters into UEFN and/or use them in your islands.
2. **Limits to KPop Demon Hunter environment assets and props.** Do not create or import environment assets or props that intend to replicate content from the movie or other licensed media. You are encouraged to mashup Fortnite and KPop Demon Hunters assets that are provided to you using the native UEFN modelling tools.
3. **Don’t use music from the official KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack in your island.** Rights to use these tracks are not included in this program and you cannot include them in your experience.
4. **Don’t sell, license, or redistribute KPop Demon Hunters Characters or Assets.** Do not sell, license, or redistribute any KPop Demon Hunters characters or assets on a stand-alone basis or as part of a database or marketplace, or in any other way that could allow a third party to access, download, extract, or exploit any KPop Demon Hunters characters or assets as a stand-alone file.
5. **No Modification.** Do not edit, modify or change any KPop Demon Hunters characters or assets outside of UEFN. Only use the UEFN customization that we’ve provided for KPop Demon Hunters characters and assets.
6. **Don’t advertise, preach, or campaign.** Do not use the KPop Demon Hunters characters or assets in connection with the advertising or promotion of any products or services, or to support, align with, or make statements regarding any sensitive topics, for example, political or religious organizations.
7. **Netflix owns and retains all rights and title to all KPop Demon Hunters characters and assets.** This includes all intellectual property rights therein. Your use of any KPop Demon Hunters characters and assets does not grant you any ownership rights in any KPop Demon Hunters characters, assets, or content, or derivatives thereof.

The KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules are enforced by Epic Games and Netflix. Netflix can report your island to Epic Games for violating the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules.

If your island is found to be violating the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules, your content will be removed, and you will not be eligible for engagement payout awards for that island. If you repeatedly violate the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules, you will lose access to the KPop Demon Hunters templates. Continued violation of these rules may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

### Converting Your Island into a KPop Demon Hunters Island

Epic Games may introduce an option that permits creators to convert existing islands into KPop Demon Hunters islands. If you want to convert an existing island, see [Converting Your Island Into a Brand Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/converting-your-island-into-a-brand-island-in-fortnite).

### Never Use KPop Demon Hunters Assets with Third-Party IP

KPop Demon Hunters islands are already set up with the brand appropriate KPop Demon Hunters assets you are allowed to use as part of the agreement as well as certain Epic Games owned or licensed assets. The IP Partner Licensing agreement makes clear that you cannot mix KPop Demon Hunters assets with other 3rd party Intellectual Property (IP), even if the owner of the IP has given their approval. You can import and use assets that you own all the rights to if they are compliant with the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules listed above and all other relevant agreements. You can also use other assets provided to you directly by Epic Games, excluding assets from another IP Partner Program partner (such as with LEGO® Islands).

If you violate this rule your island may not be eligible for engagement payout awards and may be removed from the ecosystem or disabled. Continued violation of this rule may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

## Monetizing KPop Demon Hunters Islands

Netflix is providing a limited license to their content for you to use their approved KPop Demon Hunters assets. This will allow you to bring an officially licensed KPop Demon Hunters experience into the Fortnite ecosystem, and create new types of islands for the Fortnite community. In return, you must comply with the terms of the IP Partner Licensing Agreement including the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules, and the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, Community Guidelines, and all other relevant agreements. The only approved KPop Demon Hunters assets and features are the ones accessed through the designated templates.

In consideration for Netflix’s license to you to use the KPop Demon Hunters assets to create your KPop Demon Hunters island, you agree to share 15% of your total island payout with Netflix. Epic Games will automatically deduct this amount from your engagement payout and distribute it to Netflix, and you will receive the remainder. You agree to this process when you agree to the IP Partner Licensing Agreement.

## Promoting Your KPop Demon Hunters Island

When creating media for your island, reference the guidelines outlined in [Promoting Your Fortnite Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island). Make sure images and videos accurately reflect the island or game mechanics you created and don’t copy another game or creator. Your promotion of your KPop Demon Hunters island must comply with the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules, Fortnite [Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules), Community Guidelines, and other relevant agreements (e.g., Section 3 of the Fortnite Island Creator Rules). The content and messaging in your promotion must be consistent with the content rules and guidelines in such rules and agreements and age appropriate for the target audience of your island.

### Thumbnails, Lobby Background Images, and Videos

You may have noticed that some of the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules relate to your promotional assets as well. Here are some specific guidelines on the KPop Demon Hunters Brand Rules for your promotional materials.

You can:

- Use KPop Demon Hunters characters and assets provided to you in UEFN in your thumbnails, lobby backgrounds, and videos, so long as they follow the existing guidelines.
- Use "KPop Demon Hunters", “Huntrix”, “Huntr/x”, “Saja Boys”, and “Honmoon” in your island name.

You cannot:

- Use any images, key art, music, or marketing material from the KPop Demon Hunters movie in the thumbnail, lobby background, videos, or promotional material for your island.
- Use third-party IP in your island’s thumbnail, background, or videos.
- Claim or imply that your island is affiliated with or endorsed by Netflix or the KPop Demon Hunters brand.
- Use any KPop Demon Hunters logo or similarly styled logos in your island thumbnail.
- Use any Netflix logos or trademarks belonging to Netflix in your island's name, description, or promotional imagery. For example, you cannot add the Netflix "N" logo, or anything that reflects usage of Netflix logos or trademarks.
- Use any KPop Demon Hunters actor name, images or likenesses, and any other images designed to evoke them. 
  This does not prohibit use of in-game cosmetics.

### Your Island in Discover

In the Creator Portal, KPop Demon Hunters islands are automatically tagged with “KPop Demon Hunters” during the publishing process for a special tag that will appear in the product details page.

Creator-made KPop Demon Hunters islands will show up in Discover and are searchable, like any other Fortnite island.
