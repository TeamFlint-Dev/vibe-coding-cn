## Rules for Using Squid Games Templates

In order to build with **Squid Game** templates, there are rules you need to follow in addition to the [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and other existing agreements such as the Monetization Agreement.

### Squid Game Brand Rules

When building using Squid Game templates and promoting your islands that use Squid Game templates you must adhere to the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, and all other relevant agreements and the following rules or you could risk experiencing the consequences discussed below.

For your Squid Game islands, these rules apply:

1. **Limits to Squid Game Characters and Assets.** Do not import any Squid Game-related characters or assets that may infringe the Squid Game intellectual property, into UEFN and/or use them in your islands. You may only use the Squid Game characters or assets officially provided to you in UEFN.
2. **Don’t sell, license, or redistribute Squid Game Characters or Assets.** Do not sell, license, or redistribute any Squid Game characters or assets on a stand-alone basis or as part of a database or marketplace, or in any other way that could allow a third party to access, download, extract, or exploit any Squid Game characters or assets as a stand-alone file.
3. **No Modification.** Do not edit, modify or change any Squid Game characters or assets outside of UEFN. Only use the UEFN customization that we’ve provided for Squid Game characters and assets.
4. **Don’t advertise, preach, or campaign.** Do not use the Squid Game characters or assets in connection with the advertising or promotion of any products or services, or to support, align with, or make statements regarding any sensitive topics, for example, political or religious organizations.
5. **Netflix owns and retains all rights and title to all Squid Game characters and assets.** This includes all intellectual property rights therein. Your use of any Squid Game characters and assets does not grant you any ownership rights in any Squid Game characters, assets, or content, or derivatives thereof.

The Squid Game Brand Rules are enforced by Epic Games and Netflix. Netflix can report your island to Epic Games for violating the Squid Game Brand Rules. If your island is found to be violating the Squid Game Brand Rules, your content will be removed, and you will not be eligible for engagement payout awards for that island. If you repeatedly violate the Squid Game Brand Rules, you will lose access to the Squid Game templates. Continued violation of these rules may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

### Converting Your Island Into a Squid Game Island

Epic Games may introduce an option that permits creators to convert existing islands into Squid Game islands during the window between the tools launch and publishing. In order for your island to be converted into a Squid Game island, it must contain at least one (1) tool, device, or asset from the available Squid Game toolkit. You are permitted to use regular Fortnite assets not associated with Squid Game islands.

### Never Use Squid Game Assets With Third-Party IP

Squid Game islands are already set up with the brand appropriate Squid Game assets you are allowed to use as part of the agreement as well as certain Epic Games owned or licensed assets. The IP Partner Licensing agreement makes clear that you cannot mix Squid Game assets with other 3rd party Intellectual Property (IP), even if the owner of the IP has given their approval. You can import and use assets that you own all the rights to if they are compliant with the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, Squid Game Brand Rules listed above and all other relevant agreements. You can also use other assets provided to you directly by Epic Games, excluding assets from another IP Partner Program partner (such as with LEGO® Islands).

If you violate this rule your island may not be eligible for engagement payout awards and may be removed from the ecosystem or disabled. Continued violation of this rule may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

## Monetizing Squid Game Islands

Netflix is providing a limited license to their content for you to use their approved Squid Game assets. This will allow you to bring an officially licensed Squid Game experience into the Fortnite ecosystem, and create new types of islands for the Fortnite community. In return, you must comply with the terms of the IP Partner Licensing Agreement including the Squid Game Brand Rules, and the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, Community Guidelines, and all other relevant agreements. The only approved Squid Game assets and features are the ones accessed through the designated templates.

In consideration for Netflix’s license to you to use the Squid Game assets to create your Squid Game island, you agree to share 15% of your total island payout with Netflix. Epic Games will automatically deduct this amount from your engagement payout and distribute it to Netflix, and you will receive the remainder. You agree to this process when you agree to the IP Partner Licensing Agreement.

## Working with Squid Game Assets

Squid Game uses a host of new tools so you can build childhood-themed games, enhanced social experiences, and intriguing gameplay scenarios. It unlocks new storytelling potential through teamwork, deception, or surprise twists. Use the provided Squid Game assets and galleries to create your own original environments filled with mini-games that focus on these different aspects! You can check out the galleries, items, and more at [Working with Squid Game Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-squid-game-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

### Promoting your Squid Game Island

When creating media for your island, reference the guidelines outlined in [Promoting Your Fortnite Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island). Make sure images and videos accurately reflect the island or game mechanics you created and don’t copy another game or creator. Your promotion of your Squid Game island must comply with the Squid Game Brand Rules, [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules), Community Guidelines, and other relevant agreements (e.g., Section 3 of the Fortnite Island Creator Rules). The content and messaging in your promotion must be consistent with the content rules and guidelines in such rules and agreements and age appropriate for the target audience of your island.

### Thumbnails, Lobby Background Images, and Videos

You may have noticed that some of the Squid Game Brand Rules relate to your promotional assets as well. Here are some specific guidelines on the Squid Game Brand Rules for your promotional materials.

You **can**:

- Use Squid Game characters and assets provided to you in UEFN in your thumbnails, lobby backgrounds, and videos, so long as they follow the existing guidelines.
- Use "Squid Game" in your island name.

You **cannot**:

- Use any specific title of any Squid Game episode from the Netflix TV series.
- Use third-party IP in your island’s thumbnail, background, or videos.
- Claim or imply that your island is affiliated with or endorsed by Netflix or the Squid Game brand.
- Use any Squid Game or Netflix logo in your island title or description.
- Use any Squid Game or Netflix logo or trademarks in the name of your island title or description. For clarity, trademarks that you cannot use in the name of your island title or description include, but are not limited to:

  - Squid Game series
  - Squid Game Unleashed
  - Squid Game: Unleashed
  - Netflix
  - Netflix, Inc
  - Squid Game The Challenge
  - Squid Game The Experience
- Use any Squid Game actor names (including character names), images or likenesses, and any other images designed to evoke them.

### Your Island in Discover

In the Creator Portal, Squid Game islands are automatically tagged with “Squid Game” during the publishing process for a special tag that will appear in the product details page.

Creator-made Squid Game islands will show up in Discover and are searchable, like any other Fortnite island.
