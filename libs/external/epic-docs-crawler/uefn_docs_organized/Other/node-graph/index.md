A visual representation of an interconnected system of audio processing [nodes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/node) used to generate, modify, and route sound in a game engine.

Each **node** in the graph represents a functional component, such as an audio source, filter, effect, mixer, or output. These nodes are connected by links that define the flow of audio signals. In **UEFN**, an audio node graph enables dynamic and procedural sound design by allowing creators to build complex audio behaviors, such as spatialization, reverb, and real-time audio effects.
