All islands in Discover are assigned an age rating. You cannot publish an island without a rating. On this step, you can also choose to use the email you entered as a public customer service address, or provide a different one. Both the email for IARC communications and public email address fields are required before proceeding.

The IARC questionnaire asks you a series of questions about the content of your island’s gameplay. This includes what players experience, the language used to communicate to players, and more.

You must provide accurate responses to all questions, accurately reflecting the content in your project. For more information about some of the terms and questions in the IARC questionnaire, see **[Considerations When Responding to the IARC Questionnaire](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative#considerations-when-responding-to-the-iarc-questionnaire)**.

If you notice a mistake in your answers, you can go back to the previous screen to correct your response(s).

Based on your questionnaire, ratings are assigned to your game. Review your answers to ensure they accurately reflect your island, then click the **check box** to agree to the ratings your island receives from IARC.

Click **Finished** to return to the Creator Portal. The assigned ratings now display on the Rating screen. Click **Next** to continue onto the **Promotional Media** screen.

[![Clicking Next takes you back to the Creator Portal where your rating is applied to your island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/99fe2bb4-de93-44a4-9715-dd46b7cd248c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/99fe2bb4-de93-44a4-9715-dd46b7cd248c?resizing_type=fit)

## Game Ratings

Islands receive ratings to let parents know the type of games their children are playing, and help the parents choose islands that are age-appropriate for their kids. Ratings are also helpful in filtering out islands that are not appropriate for children of certain ages.

By completing the IARC questionnaire, islands go through a streamlined rating process that enables creators to obtain age ratings from different regions around the world. IARC assigned age ratings are automatically applied and prominently displayed to players in each respective region prior to accessing Fortnite islands.

## IARC Questionnaire

The IARC questionnaire includes questions regarding factors that each participating rating authority considers most pertinent when assigning ratings. For in-depth information on the IARC rating system and how it’s applied to your island, see the **[IARC Overview and FAQs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative)** documentation.

IARC ratings can be appealed. The appeals process takes time and may delay your ability to publish your island.
