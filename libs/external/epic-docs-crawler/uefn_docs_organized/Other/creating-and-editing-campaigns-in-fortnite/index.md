[Sponsored Row Campaigns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#sponsored-row) help developers drive visibility for their islands in Discover. Sponsoring an island can help you reach a wider audience, grow your player base, and potentially increase your revenue.

[Campaigns](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#campaign) are [bid on in an auction](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/campaign-bidding-and-auction-mechanics-in-fortnite) based on the campaigns island owners create and manage through the Creator Portal.

To create a campaign:

## Campaign Data

As you enter your campaign budgetary information, a preview of the campaign’s Budget subtotal, the current value of your bid, and metrics appear on the Campaign template. Once you’ve added a bid, the Full trend Data populates with information. Below is a breakdown of the data that populates around the campaign you build.

### Campaign Budget Calculator

The amounts entered in each field appear in the **Campaign Budget Calculator** on the right-side of the setup fields.

[![The amounts entered in each field appear in the Budget calculator.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cb615e0b-4461-4d66-80b9-f70b7a6e7b7d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cb615e0b-4461-4d66-80b9-f70b7a6e7b7d?resizing_type=fit)

Click image to enlarge.

### Market History

On the first day of the campaign, this chart remains empty until sufficient player data is collected. Once data is available, the Market History chart shows the 7-day average Click Per 1,000 Impressions ([CPM](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#cpm)) by default (reviewable in 1 day, 7 day, 30 day, 90 day, Year To Date, and 1 year delineations).

[![An example of the Market History chart.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3b7f2539-34ef-4f26-973d-76b06eaac6cc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3b7f2539-34ef-4f26-973d-76b06eaac6cc?resizing_type=fit)

Click image to enlarge.

Use the Market History chart to:

- Compare your bid against recent winning prices.
- Decide if you need to adjust your CPM to stay competitive.
- Understand seasonal or daily shifts in bidding.

On your campaign launch day, this chart remains empty until one full day’s worth of data is collected.

### Impressions Estimate

As you set your budget and CPM, the system calculates [estimated impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#estimated-impressions). If your campaign is projected to deliver **fewer than 5,000 impressions per day**, a warning appears to inform you that outcomes may be less impactful.

## Editing, Pausing, and Canceling a Campaign

Once you successfully submit a campaign you have the option to edit, pause, or cancel the campaign before it goes live. You can also pause or cancel your campaign at any time after the campaign goes live.

You can only edit the campaign name and duration once the campaign is live. If you want to change the bid or budget you will need to create a new campaign.

## Campaign Creation Guidelines

To create a successful campaign there are a few guidelines in place:

- During the campaign setup, only islands that are published, listed, and in good standing appear in the Island dropdown menu.
- Downranked islands do not appear in the Island dropdown menu.
- [Island versions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/campaign-faqs-in-fortnite#which-islands-are-eligible) that have been removed for Low Performance do not appear in the Island dropdown menu. To get a removed island to display in the dropdown:

  - Use your metrics in [Project Analytics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/project-analytics-for-fortnite-games) to help evaluate your island's performance and determine the next steps.
  - [Update and republish](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) your island based on metrics learnings and create a new campaign.
- Campaigns cannot have the same name as any other campaign.
- Multiple campaigns cannot be scheduled for the same island for the same date
- Campaigns can only have a maximum duration of 30 days.
- The end of a campaign must be 90 days from the day you submit your campaign.
- If there is a payment issue for one of your campaigns, all active campaigns will be paused until you update your payment method and successfully pay for the outstanding balance; then the paused campaigns will resume.
- If you have an overdue charge on a campaign, all of your campaigns will be canceled after 7 days of non-payment.
- If you update your Island to a new release version or unpublish your island, we will cancel all active campaigns for the island. Campaigns are associated directly with an Island version.

## Common Campaign Submission Errors

Islands must go through moderation before they are approved for Sponsored Row. In addition to the **[Fortnite Developer Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules)**, [**Epic Games Content Guidelines**](https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/content-guidelines) and [**Epic Games Community Rules**](https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/community-rules) your content must also adhere to the Sponsored Row Content Rules (Section 5 of the Fortnite Developer Rules) to be eligible for Sponsored Row. Below is a list of the most common errors developers might make when creating a campaign. Islands must NOT contain the following:

- Real-world quick serve restaurants and real-world food and beverage.
- Cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or real world currencies and banks as part of their island experience.
- Political party affiliation for campaigning or messaging, including content related to religious or charitable causes, and Political Action Committees (PACs).

Sponsored Row islands must also adhere to the [thumbnail guidelines](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/thumbnail-image-guidelines-for-discover).
