A device in Creative that, when placed, lets you register items on it by dropping them on the spawner. While an [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#itemgranter) adds items directly into a player's inventory, an Item Spawner drops an item on the island when triggered, and the player must pick it up.
