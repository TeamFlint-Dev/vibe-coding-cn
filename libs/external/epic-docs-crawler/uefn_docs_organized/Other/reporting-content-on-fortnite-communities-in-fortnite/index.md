Community posts and content are visible from the web and the Fortnite ecosystem. Due to the public nature of communities and posts, it’s best to ensure the content and community visitors in your communities adhere to the **[Fortnite Communities Guidelines](https://communities.epicgames.com/fortnite-communities-guidelines)**.

If a person is posting content that violates the guidelines and [Epic Games Terms of Service](https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/tos), you should report that person immediately.

## Finding Community Content

The following are the various places where community content is visible in Fortnite:

### Message of the Day

Community content appears as the **Message of The Day** on an Island lobby tile.
