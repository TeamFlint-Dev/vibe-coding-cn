In [Modify and Run Your First Verse Program](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/modify-and-run-your-first-verse-program-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), you learned how to access **Verse** through **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**, and how to modify a Verse program and troubleshoot your code.

Now you can start learning the basics of writing code in Verse, along with learning a few fundamentals for programming in general.

What you have here is a series of lessons. Each lesson has a little hands-on exercise at the end to help you retain the info from the lesson. In the best of all possible worlds, you would move through each lesson sequentially, and in a relatively short time.

Each lesson should take you 3–10 minutes to complete.

So get ready to have some fun while you learn to write some code with Verse!
