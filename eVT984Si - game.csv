This brings entity workflows in line with what’s already possible for actors, now with support for toggling sets of entities on/off, segmenting gameplay phases, and streamlining large map editing. This should bring the feature set of entities and prefabs within the prefab editor on par, if not better in many cases, compared to traditional Level Instance based actor and variants workflows.

Two interfaces anchor this capability: has\_collisions for event-driven physical interaction, and has\_dynamics for enabling per-part forces, impulses, and full physics state replication suitable for networked gameplay. This work also establishes a standardized mesh_part initialization workflow to ensure that each asset cleanly exposes its intended physics representation during setup.
