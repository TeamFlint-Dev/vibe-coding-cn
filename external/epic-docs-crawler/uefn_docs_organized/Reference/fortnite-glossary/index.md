Games and game design have a unique language set made up in part of slang with a sprinkle of science, and a little magic and fun to fill the cracks. Use this list of key words to learn more about the Fortnite Ecosystem, and check back frequently — this is forever a work in progress, and we drop new terms as they reveal themselves. Your devoted lexicographers are always on the hunt.

See the [Verse Glossary](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary)  for terms related to the Verse programming language. For those who are interested, the Verse Glossary also contains a number of basic programming terms with definitions designed for those who are learning programming for the first time.

:   A 0 dB does not represent no sound. Think of 0 dB as maximum volume. For example, if your receiver reads -25 dB, it means that the volume of the signal has been attenuated by 25 dB (made 25 dB quieter than the loudest it could possibly be) before being output to your speakers.

2D audio
:   Sound that plays without [spatialization](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#spatialization). This means that the sound does not change as a player moves through the game. Compare to [3D audio](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#3d-audio).

avatar
:   The image, persona, or character in Fortnite that represents **you**.

axis
:   An axis is a a fixed reference line for the measurement of coordinates.

    Fortnite takes place in three dimensions, so to locate something in the space, you need three points of reference, or three axes. These points are called the **Left**, or **L-axis** (formerly the **Y-axis**), the **Up**, or **U-axis** (formerly the **Z-axis**), and the **Forward**, or **F-axis** (formerly the **X-axis**). Collectively, these coordinates are called **LUF**.

    Imagine you are looking over a flat plane. Place a dot in the center of the plane. This is your **0** point for all dimensions. Draw a line from north to south (away from you and toward you) and make sure it goes through the 0 point. This is **F**. Now draw a line that crosses at the 0 point, but goes east to west, (left to right). This is **L**. Draw a third line that also goes through the 0 point, crossing where the other two lines cross, but going straight up and down. This is **U**. Using those three lines, you can position any object in a three-dimensional space.

    **X-axis** and **Y-axis** are still used, but only for coordinates limited to two dimensions —   such as in reference to UI content. The X-axis refers to a location left of the origin (negative values) or right of the origin (positive values). The Y-axis refers to a location down from the origin (negative values) or up from the origin (positive values).

When a control is manipulated, it looks at how the movement will affect the controls down the chain (a forward solve) and well as how its movement affects controls higher in the chain (backward solve), basically double-checking the work. Some animations and features rely on the forward or backward solve in order to add effects or motion to the character at [runtime](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#runtime).

calibration
:   When an island that uses [accolades](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#accoladesdevice) is published, it will go through a calibration process to evaluate how often players receive each accolade compared to how long they play. The calibration system requires a number of play sessions over time to make the calculations it needs to accurately calibrate the island. Once calibration is complete, the [weights](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#weight) for each level of [XP](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#xp) award are determined.

chromatic aberration
:   Refraction is when light bends as it passes from one transparent substance into another, and affects how objects are perceived. For example. rainbows are the result of refraction. Chromatic aberration is the effect from refraction when different wavelengths of light pass through slightly different angles, resulting in a failure to focus. Depending on the amount of chromatic aberration used in a post-process volume, you will either end up with some blurring around the edges of the scene, or with blurring throughout the entire scene.

chromatic scale

clean collision
:   Some walls and other props have irregular shapes. A player walking past one of these can snag on the shape if they touch it. One way to compensate for this is to put an invisible barrier along such a shape that will help the player slide smoothly along the barrier surface, which gives the illusion they are sliding smoothly along the irregular surface. This is called a clean collision.

click-through rate
:   See [CTR](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#ctr).

clicks
:   A user's active interaction with a button, tile, or other link. Clicks are recorded to measure engagement.

collision
:   If an [asset](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#asset) has collision enabled, this means it is solid to the player's character and the character cannot pass through it. For example, if you place a Barrier around the edge of an island, players are blocked and can't fall off the edge. You can also use collision settings for things you want a player or character to interact with. You can't attack something that doesn't have collision enabled, for example. You can't pick up something that doesn't have collision either — a character's hand just passes through it.

collision primitive
:   A simple, primitive shape, such as a box or sphere, that can be used to set collision boundaries and other object behaviors.

    Compare to [event](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#event).

gain
:   While gain and volume are closely related, there are differences. Volume is how loud something is, while gain is how much an audio signal is increased by an amplifier. Adjusting the volume does not affect the [waveform](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#waveform). However, increasing the gain does, and this can cause [distortion](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#distortion).

game mode
:   In Fortnite, mode is about who can play, and how. For example, for some games you can pick a mode for how many players are on your team: solo, duo, trio, or squad. Another mode option is where the game is public or private.

game phase
:   A phase is a separate part of something. There are three distinct game phases: [pre-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#pre-gamephase) (players are loaded in but the match hasn't started), [warm-up](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#warm-upphase) (the three-second countdown at the beginning of the match), and [gameplay](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#gameplayphase) (when the game is running). Game phases are a subset of [game states](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#gamestates).

gameplay loop
:   A gameplay loop is the experience a player goes through, over and over, until the objective is reached. A good gameplay loop would include a player action, a reward or some other feedback for that action, and an expansion of that reward or feedback through repeated action. This could mean more loot, better weapons, more knowledge revealed, or other incentives to continue the player's engagement. The gameplay loop is the core experience of a game, and the thing that keeps players coming back for more.

gameplay phase
:   The phase when a game is running. See [game phase](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#gamephase).

glider
:   A glider is used in Fortnite when first landing on an island, or when jumping or falling from a high spot. You can change the appearance of your glider much the same way you'd change an outfit. Note that in Creative, you can set player spawners that deploy a player directly onto the island without having to fall or glide in.

global illumination
:   Provides more realistic lighting in your scene by using algorithms that account for both light originating from a light source and reflections off of nearby objects.

global settings

glTF
:   This file format name comes from Graphics Language Transmission Format. It is a standard file format for 3D scenes and models. A glTF file uses one of two possible file extensions: .gltf (JSON/ASCII) or .glb (binary). Both .gltf and .glb files can reference external binary and texture resources. Alternatively, both formats may be self-contained by directly embedding binary data buffers (as base64-encoded strings in .gltf files or as raw byte arrays in .glb files). This is an open standard developed and maintained by the Khronos Group, and it supports 3D model geometry, appearance, scene graph hierarchy, and animation.

GOAT

This is the closest you can get to testing exactly what will happen in-game.

golden rift
:   The rift in the Creative hub that takes you to your own islands. Only one rift is a golden rift. This is the only rift that you can customize to create and access your personal islands. Most rifts have a white glow, but your personal rift has a golden glow. Also see [personal rift](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#personalrift).

grenade
:   One of any number of throwable weapons. For example, the Chiller Grenade encases a player's feet in ice, while a Shockwave Grenade causes knockback to anyone within range — including the thrower!

Grenade Launcher
:   A rifle that shoots grenades.

greybox
:   See [grayboxing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#grayboxing).

grid
:   A level is marked with lines in a grid pattern. You can use these grid lines to position [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#prop) and [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#device), and to measure distances. Each grid area is called a tile. Grids are measured in [UUs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#unrealunits), and one tile equals 512 UU.

grid plane
:   A grid plane is an area that cannot be edited, but that you can place objects on. If you're going to create custom terrains, you need to remove the grid plane(s) in your project before you can do this. To select a grid plane, make sure you're in Selections Mode, then click on the grid. It will now have a yellow border. To remove the selected grid plane, press the **Delete** key. Also see [Landscape Streaming Proxy](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#landscapestreamingproxy).

grid snap
:   UEFN inherits its grid-snapping values, known as [**Unreal Units (UU)**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#unrealunits), from Unreal Engine (UE) for all [actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#actor). Inside UE, 1 UU is equal to 1 centimeter (CM). This means smaller snap values cause the actor to snap in smaller increments, or alternatively, larger snap values cause actors to snap in larger increments. This is the opposite of how grid snapping works in Fortnite, where the smaller the grid-snapping value, the larger the incremental snap.

    However, Building Actors do use the Fortnite grid snapping values. You can enable and disable Fortnite grid-snapping properties in **World Settings** by toggling **Editor Cell Snap** on and off for Building Actors. Changing your grid snapping levels does not affect non-Building Actors.

:   Graphic symbols (icons) used to convey information. An icon communicates in a visually recognizable way in a game, and can represent a quality or an action.

IK rigging
:   Kinematics is the study of motion. Inverse Kinematics, or IK, is the process in 3D animation that uses joint articulation to create both poses and movement. Rigging is how these poses and movements are mapped to a skeletal mesh.

immersive experience
:   To fully immerse players, game developers use realistic actions that blend in with the environment they create.

impression
:   An impression is a player view of your island thumbnail. To be counted as an impression, your island's thumbnail must be 100% visible on the screen and viewable for two seconds or more. If a player clicks your thumbnail, even if it's not fully visible or does not appear for the full two seconds, the impression will still count as an impression based on the click-through result.

impressions-to-clicks-to-plays
:   The impressions-to-clicks-to-plays flow for an island involves generating awareness (impressions), capturing interest (clicks), and driving action (plays).

in-game
:   Refers to anything that happens while a game is in progress, or when the player is in [Play mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#playmode).

in-game resolution
:   Resolution is the number of pixels per inch that display on a monitor. While different consoles have different resolution settings, a video game runs at its own in-game resolution regardless of console settings. What this means is that the in-game resolution directly affects performance. Higher in-game resolution causes the GPU to work harder to render more pixels, resulting in lower frame rates. Console resolution does not affect gaming performance.

increment score
:   When a score is set to be awarded on an incremental base, this means the score will increase based on the increment value. For example, if the base is 5, then each score awarded will be based on 5 — so 5, then 10, then 15, and so on.

infantry rifle
:   A rifle that holds up to 10 bullets.

infection
:   A game where one or more people start as infected and have to pass this on to other players by touching them.

instance
:   Think of an instance as a unique copy of an [asset](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#asset). The original asset determines the default properties of any new instance you create. Changes you make to the properties for an instance don't affect the original asset. For example, you can change a [material](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#material) to have a different appearance without changing the master material. This would be a material instance.

    In Verse, an instance is to create a [variable](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#variable), specify its [identifier](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#identifier) and [type](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#type), which is called [declaring a variable](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#declare), and assign a value to the variable, which is called **initializing**.

Also see [Creator Economy 2.0](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#creatoreconomy2.0).

island template
:   In Unreal Editor for Fortnite, an island template is basically an empty island with terrain or other environmental features, much like the starter islands available in Fortnite. These templates are available on the **Project Browser** screen in UEFN.

island theme
:   Each starter island in Fortnite has a visual theme. For example, Arctic Island is a snowy area with some mountains, while Wasteland Island is a flat, sandy desert. [Props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) are designed to work with different island themes. When you start adding [objects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#object) to your island, they should stay within a similar theme. For example, it might be a little wierd to put palm trees on an arctic island, or an arctic test lab on a desert island. Themes extend throughout all of the objects and [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#item) that you can place on the island.

island tutorial
:   See [full island tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#fullislandtutorial).

A LSR will have some template records and many instance records.

level system
:   A level system in a game is a way for a player to accumulate points. When the player earns enough points, they are upgraded to the next level. Points are usually earned by winning battles, achieving specific objectives, or through other play achievements. Level systems are most common in [RPG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#rpg) games, where leveling up unlocks a new set of skills or weapons, but are also sometimes found in other game modes.

LLM
:   A large language model, or LLM, is a computer program trained to process and output natural language through text. You can view the model as learned knowledge from a library of resources (database) on the topic of language. Some training material sets are small while others are large. Through the training, the model can predict a string of text it should produce in response to a prompt, making it appear as though it were aware and thinking.

    The language model can generate human language through text using [algorithms](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#:~:text=you%20need%20here!-,algorithm,-An%20algorithm%20is) to learn pattern recognition and relationships between words from the training material.

:   Local exposure is an effect in post processing that automatically applies adjustments to exposure within user-controlled parameters to preserve both highlight and shadow detail on top of existing global exposure. This is useful for projects with challenging high dynamic range scenes using dynamic lighting, in which applying a single global exposure adjustment is not enough to avoid blown out highlights and completely dark shadows.

local position
:   The position of a pixel or vertex relative to an object.

local space
:   This is the space that is relative to an object with no rotation or transformation.

Lock

LOD
:   Short for **level of detail**. This refers to the level of detail that shows in a Static Mesh based on distance away from it.

Selecting Auto lets Creative do the thinking for you.

material
:   A material is an asset that can be applied to a mesh to control the visual look of the scene. At a high level, it is easiest to think of a material as the “paint” that’s applied to an object. But even that can be misleading, since a material literally defines the type of surface from which your object appears to be made. You can define its color, shininess, transparency, and much more. In more technical terms, when light from the scene hits the surface, a material is used to calculate how that light interacts with that surface. These calculations use incoming data that is input to the material from a variety of images (textures) and math expressions, as well as from various property settings inherent to the material itself.

    Unreal Engine utilizes a physically based shading model. This means that rather than defining a material using arbitrary properties (such as diffuse color and specular power), you instead use properties more easily relatable to the real world. These include base color, metallic, specular, and roughness.

material function
:   A way of grouping a node graph so that it can be used as a single node. Material functions are little snippets of material graphs that can be saved in packages and reused across multiple materials.

As a [creator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#creator), once you've published one or more islands, you will want to see the metrics on how players respond to them so you can improve the player experience.

mini-game
:   A small game, sometimes called a side game, within a larger game. A mini-game might show up in a lobby where players who are waiting to get into the main game can play while they're waiting.

minutes played per impression
:   **Minutes played per impression** is the ratio between impressions and total minutes played. For example, if your experience has 1000 minutes played in the last 96 hours after receiving 100 impressions in the same period, your minutes per impression would be 10. This metric shows whether your impressions are converting to sustained engagement.

modularity
:   If an asset imported into UEFN includes elements that could be used separately, it should be modular. For example, an asset could be a market stall with baskets and fruit. It could be one complete unit, or you could make the baskets and fruit as separate meshes that could be used on their own.

    This term also refers to architectural assets that can be used together to create a building and rooms within the building.

:   1. What the player has to accomplish to meet the [win condition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#wincondition). Depending on the game type, the objective could be anything from accumulating a specific item or the most items, to finishing a task in the least time.
    2. A [game type](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#gametype) where the game has specific rules on how it is won or lost, and the player has to complete a specific objective to win.

Objective Device Gallery
:   A selection of destructible items that you can use as game objectives. This gallery is found in the [Devices category](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#devicescategory) under the [Content tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#contenttab).

Objectives to End
:   A device setting that you can use to end a round when a certain number of objectives have been completed by a player or team.

Octane Spawner
:   A device that spawns a lightweight vehicle that defies gravity with rocket-boosting, jumping, and aerial maneuverability.

octave
:   A range of musical notes in the interval between (and including) two notes, where the first note has twice the frequency of vibration of the other. It's called an octave because it includes eight notes, represented by C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C. An octave can start at any note. Also see [pitch](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#pitch).

octave offset
:   The shift of a scale to a different [key](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#key).

offline progression
:   With offline progression, some aspect of a game will continue to progress while closed as though the player were still in the game. For example, in a farming game that uses this mechanic, crops would continue to grow while the player is logged out of the game. There is usually a time limit for how long offline progression continues. Also see [persistence](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#persistence).

onboarding
:   To onboard a new player means to make them familiar with the basic rules of the game, how the game works, win conditions, and so on.

:   An elimination-based game mode where a player needs to eliminate an opponent in order to receive ammo.

one life
:   Any game where players have only one life and cannot respawn after elimination.

:   To defeat or to be defeated in a single hit.

one-v-one
:   See [1v1](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#1v1).

OP
:   When something is stronger than it should be, whether it's a character, a weapon, or any other in-game element, it can be referred to as overpowered, or OP. Think of it as overpowered as in having too much power.

open world
:   An open-world game is one where the player has the freedom to explore the world without having to stick to a strictly [linear](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#linear) approach. The open-world approach is common in [MMORPGs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#mmorpg). The world persists with or without players. Players can come and go, and have a lot more freedom in how they want to play the game. Also see [nonlinear](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#nonlinear).

orientation
:   Imagine a plane moving through the sky. Now imagine that the plane is turning right, then left. That motion of turning left or right is called **yaw**. Next, imagine the nose of the plane pointing up toward the sky or down toward the ground. This is called **pitch**. Finally, have you ever seen a stunt plane that looks like it's flying sideways, with one wing pointing up and the other down? Or even flying completely upside down? This is called **roll**. These three values control three-dimensional orientation. Compare to [axis](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#axis), which controls location in three dimensions.

orthographic
:   A 2D representation of a 3D object or space. In an orthographic view, all objects appear at the same scale, unlike a perspective view, where distant objects are scaled smaller.

oscillator
:   An oscillator shifts a value, such as volume or tone, between two levels, usually with a repeating pattern.

    In Patchwork, one example of oscillator use is the [LFO Modulator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchworklfomodulator) device, which uses an oscillator to continuously adjust controls on other devices.

    Other Patchwork devices use oscillators to shape their output. For example, the [vibrato](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#vibrato) control on the [Patchwork Instrument Player](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchworkinstrumentplayer) uses an oscillator to rapidly shift the pitch of the audio output.

outfit
:   A character's overall appearance is called an outfit in Creative. You can change outfits by accessing your [locker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#locker) while in the [lobby](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#lobby) or [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game) if you have access to a [Changing Booth](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#changingbooth). Sometimes referred to as a skin. Also see [default outfit](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#default-skin).

Outliner panel
:   The Outliner panel, or Outliner for short, displays all [actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#actor) within a scene in a hierarchical tree view. In the panel, you also have an option to search for an actor element in the level, and to create folders to group actor elements together.

output
:   With [Patchwork](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchwork) devices, output is the end result from a [chain of Patchwork devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#devicechain), turning creations from data carried by Patchwork Cables into something users can observe. For example, a minimal chain to make music includes a [note generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#notegenerator) to define what is played, an [audio generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#audiogenerator) to define how it should sound, and an output device like a [Patchwork Speaker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchworkspeaker) so it can be heard.

overdrive
:   A type of [distortion](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#distortion) usually caused by pushing an amp past what it can produce as a clean tone.

You can move, copy, and paste it as a single asset, but you can also open it and edit the parts inside individually. This is roughly the equivalent of a [prefab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#prefab) in Fortnite.

Paid Area
:   An [offer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#item-offer) that provides access behind a paywall. An example would be access to a backstage area in a narrative-type game.

parkour
:   A sport or activity where the participant moves rapidly through obstacles by running, jumping, and climbing. It is similar to a skillrun, but a parkour game doesn't reset to the last checkpoint after failing an obstacle. A parkour course is typically in an urban environment, but can also be built in woods or open fields.

particle effect
:   A visual effect that can look like smoke, fire, glowing lights, or other interesting visuals.

Think of the Note Sequencer as your sheet music — you can't directly listen to the sequence of notes on the [note grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#notegrid). You need a way to interpret the notes, such as by a musician playing it. In Patchwork, you can patch the sequencer into an [audio generator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#audiogenerator) to interpret (generate) the music, then output to a [Patchwork Speaker](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#patchworkspeaker) to play it out loud.

Permissions category
:   On the [Island Settings tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#islandsettings), the Permissions caqtegory is where you set whether other players can edit and copy items on your island. By default, this setting is set to Private, which restricts access by anyone but yourself. Changing this setting can be really useful when you're collaborating with one or more other creators on an island. To provide access to other creators in your group, go to Island Settings, click the Permissions category, then change Island Edit and Copy Permission from Private to Everyone.

    For example, if you have an objective that can be assigned a value, consider how often this objective can be collected, how many instances of this objective are available, and how hard it is to collect. Something that is easy to obtain would have a lower weight, while something that is harder to get, or less frequently available, would get a higher weight.

Instead of whites appearing blue (cool) or orange (warm), they should appear white after correct white balancing.
