Verse is a programming language designed with video games and game-like experiences in mind. This makes it well-suited for handling game-specific needs.

## Why Verse and Creative?

Learning a new programming language can be intimidating, especially when one of the benefits of the [Creative toolset](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/fortnite-creative-glossary#creative-toolset) in Fortnite is not having to worry about [programming](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#programming).

But programming is inherent to game design.

With **Fortnite Creative**, you can construct gameplay rules using [devices](unreal%20-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#device), but you can only connect these devices in specific, pre-defined ways. If you want to do something that no existing device or combination of devices can do, that gameplay concept cannot be implemented directly on a Creative island.

This is where Verse supplements the Creative toolset by using programming to bridge the gap that existing devices can't fill. Verse gives [game developers](unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#developer) a way to create new functionalities, or simplify what would otherwise be complex device setups.

Epic Games is continuing to develop the [Verse API](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-api) for UEFN to enable more gameplay-specific functionalities. At this time, Verse is a good solution for:

- Complex interactions between players and the game world.
- Precise control over when things happen.
- Creating new game rules that would be challenging or impossible to implement with the Creative toolset alone.
- Dynamic play based on the current state of a player or the game world.
