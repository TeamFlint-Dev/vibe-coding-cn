Bad guys beware, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are loose in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)! With new TMNT assets, you can now build action-packed experiences featuring your favorite characters, environments, and props from the TMNT universe. Whether you're creating an epic battle in the streets of New York City or designing the ultimate training dojo in the sewers, UEFN gives you the power to make games using one of the best-known franchises of all time.

There are three custom templates, a full roster of TMNT characters, and an extensive selection of TMNT-themed [prefabs and galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-tmnt-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) when you create a project using the base maps found under **Brands** > **TMNT**. Each asset is designed to fit seamlessly within the Fortnite ecosystem, giving your projects that signature TMNT vibe.

You can access the assets from the TMNT folder in the Content Browser of UEFN and the Creative inventory in-game.

After creating, playtesting, and perfecting your island, you'll be ready to share your vision with the world! Make sure your island aligns with the [TMNT Brand and Creator Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-brand-and-creator-rules-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) before you publish.

## TMNT Island Templates

Take your experiences to the next level! Explore the **Arcade,****Dimension X Starter**, and **City Starter** templates. Each template is designed and built to spark your imagination and have you saying Cowabunga!

The **Dimension X Starter** island provides an out-of-this world landscape that is the perfect starting point for building multi-dimensional TMNT adventures. [Sculpt the barren landscape](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/landscape-mode-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and place pools of ooze underneath the swirling skies of outer space.

## IARC Audience Restrictions

Any TMNT islands that you create will need to have an age-appropriate rating. The TMNT island templates and Creator Portal are set up to guide you through this process. As a general rule, create your island with all audiences in mind.

The table below shows each Rating Authority, region, and the age-appropriate rating for a TMNT island.

## Publishing TMNT Islands

Publishing a TMNT Island follows the same process as publishing any other Fortnite Creative island through Creator Portal. To learn more about the publishing process from UEFN, refer to [Publishing Projects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-projects-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

## Using TMNT Characters in UEFN and Creative

You can spawn all available TMNT characters wherever you can use character outfits in UEFN and Creative. This includes the four iconic Turtles, their allies, and their fearsome villains. Use the following devices in UEFN and Creative and begin creating gameplay, animating cutscenes, and building new gameplay experiences with the full suite of TMNT characters.

- [Guard Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-guard-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Character Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-character-devices-in-fortnite-creative)
- [NPC Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite)

To use TMNT characters in the Character Device or Guard Spawner devices, go to the **Details** panel, and use the **Character Cosmetic** dropdown.

To use them in the NPC Spawner, create a new **NPC Character Definition**, and use the **Character Cosmetic NPC Modifier**.

## TMNT Character Spawner

Expand your island with themed NPCs (non-playable characters) using the TMNT Character Spawner device. This device is available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Creative. Choose TMNT characters to fight alongside or against players, using their iconic weapons to perform melee attacks.
