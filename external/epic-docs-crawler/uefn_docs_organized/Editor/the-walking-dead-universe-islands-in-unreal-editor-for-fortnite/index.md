Run, don't walk! **The Walking Dead Universe** (TWDU) is available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) with everything you need to mutate your creativity so that you can design a pleasantly horrific gameplay experience.

First, take a peek at the prison-themed starter island designed so well that you'll think you are hallucinating. It's fine, you're not. Then, learn to get the best out of the new Walker NPC to create terrifying survival-horror gameplay, or summon mass hordes to mow down in powerful action sequences.

After you check out the template islands, browse through the many resources linked below to get started creating your own TWDU project.
