## Rules for Using TMNT Templates

In order to build with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ("TMNT") templates, there are rules you need to follow in addition to the [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and other existing agreements such as the Monetization Agreement. As a participant in the IP Partner Program, when you build with TMNT templates you are required to follow the rules detailed below.

Refer to the rules and instructions outlined below to make sure your island is compliant.

### TMNT Brand Rules

When building with TMNT assets and promoting your islands that use TMNT Templates you must adhere to all relevant agreements and the following TMNT Brand Rules, or you could risk experiencing the consequences discussed below.

1. **Limits to TMNT Characters.** Do not import any TMNT characters or assets into UEFN and use them in your islands. You can only use the TMNT characters or assets that are provided to you in UEFN.
2. **Don't sell or redistribute any TMNT assets.** You cannot sell, license or distribute any TMNT assets or assets on a stand-alone basis or as part of an online asset database or marketplace, or any other database including, in such a way that would allow a third party to use, download, extract, or access any TMNT assets as a stand-alone file.
3. **Keep things fun - don't advertise, preach, or campaign.**

   - **Do not advertise or promote any products, services or property in or in connection with your island.** Do not use TMNT characters as a product "spokesperson" or use TMNT assets in a manner that could imply a relationship to products, services, or property.
   - **Do not preach about sensitive topics, like political parties or religion.** Do not show TMNT assets with religious icons or in any uniform that replicates a real world political or military institution, except to the extent Epic includes those assets within Fortnite or UEFN more generally. Do not use TMNT assets to support or make a statement regarding any political or religious organization, campaign or cause (e.g., whether regarding a candidate or making a statement on an issue such as war, gun use, etc.).
4. **Restrictions on using your own assets.** You may use assets that you own all rights to in your island in compliance with the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, these TMNT Brand Rules and all other relevant agreements, except you may not use (i) intellectual property (IP) derived from film or TV or (ii) characters from major multimedia video game franchises in your TMNT islands, even if you have the rights to that IP or characters.
5. **Restrictions on use of trademarks/logos.** Do not use TMNT logos, any specific titles of any TMNT content across films, TV, video games, comics and songs or any Paramount Global or any of its affiliates ("Paramount Global Group") entity ("Restricted Trademarks") in your Island, thumbnail, title or description. You may use other TMNT trademarks (e.g., TMNT, *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles*, etc.) in an island name or description so long as your use does not imply that Paramount Global Group created or endorsed your island. For clarity, Restricted Trademarks include but are not limited to the following:

   - NICKELODEON
   - PARAMOUNT
   - RISE OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES; SHREDDER'S REVENGE
   - TMNT: SHREDDER'S REVENGE
   - TALES OF THE TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: THE LAST RONIN
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: TURTLES IN TIME
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT MAYHEM
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: COWABUNGA COLLECTION
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: BATTLE NEXUS
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANT IN MANHATTAN
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES ARCADE: WRATH OF THE MUTANTS
   - TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: MUTANTS UNLEASHED
6. **Paramount Global Group owns all rights in its characters, visual assets, or other TMNT content.** Paramount Global Group owns and retains all rights, title and interest in all TMNT content and assets, including all copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. Paramount Global Group is providing you a limited, revocable, non-transferable and non-exclusive license to the TMNT assets solely for use in your island and promotion thereof in compliance with these rules and all relevant Epic agreements. Your use of any TMNT assets does not grant you any ownership rights in any TMNT assets, content or intellectual property.

The TMNT Brand Rules are enforced by Epic and Paramount Global Group. Paramount Global Group can report your island to Epic for violating the TMNT Brand Rules. Rules relating to what you can't do with Epic's IP (including challenging any trademarks, etc.) and any disclosure obligations relating to your association with Epic will also apply to you with respect to Paramount Global IP and Paramount Global and be deemed part of the TMNT Brand Rules.

If your island is found to be violating the TMNT Brand Rules, your content will be removed, and you will not be eligible for engagement payout awards for that island. If you repeatedly violate the TMNT Brand Rules, you will lose access to the TMNT templates. Continued violation of these rules may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

### Never Use TMNT Assets with Third-Party IP

TMNT Islands are already set up with the brand appropriate TMNT assets and assets you are allowed to use as part of the agreement as well as certain Epic owned or licensed assets. The IP Partner Licensing agreement makes clear that you cannot mix TMNT assets with other 3rd party Intellectual Property (IP), even if the owner of the IP has given their approval. You can import and use assets that you own all the rights to if they are compliant with the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, TMNT Brand Rules listed above and all other relevant agreements. You can also use other assets provided to you directly by Epic Games, excluding assets from another IP Partner Program partner (such as with LEGO® Islands).

If you violate this rule your island may not be eligible for engagement payout awards and may be removed from the ecosystem or disabled. Continued violation of this rule may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

## Monetizing TMNT Islands

Paramount Global Group is providing a limited license to their content for you to use their approved TMNT assets. This will allow you to bring an officially licensed TMNT experience into the Fortnite ecosystem, and create new types of islands for the Fortnite community. In return, you must comply with the terms of the IP Partner Licensing Agreement including the TMNT Brand Rules, and the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, Community Guidelines, and all other relevant agreements. The only approved TMNT assets and features are the ones accessed through the designated templates.

In consideration for Paramount Global Group’s license to you to use the TMNT assets to create your TMNT island, you agree to share 15% of your total island payout with Paramount Global. Epic will automatically deduct this amount from your engagement payout and distribute it to Paramount Global Group, and you will receive the remainder. You agree to this process when you agree to the IP Partner Licensing Agreement.

## Promoting your TMNT Island

When creating media for your island, reference the guidelines outlined in [Promoting Your Fortnite Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island). Make sure images and videos accurately reflect the island or game mechanics you created and don’t copy another game or creator. Your promotion of your TMNT island must comply with the TMNT Brand Rules, Fortnite [Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) Community Guidelines and other relevant agreements (e.g., Section 3 of the Fortnite Island Creator Rules), and the content and messaging in your promotion must be consistent with the content rules and guidelines in such rules and agreements and age appropriate for the target audience of your island.
