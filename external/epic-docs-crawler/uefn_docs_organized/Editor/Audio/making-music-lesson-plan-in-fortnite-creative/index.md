## DESCRIPTION OF CLASS/LEARNING ENVIRONMENT

This lesson is designed for **Hour of Code** during Computer Science Education Week.

It is designed as a music lesson so it could also be used in a music course. Music composition is an important element in game design, and this lesson provides a great opportunity for students to experience music composition in the context of a game development course. This can serve as a stand-alone lesson, or be used in conjunction with the other activities to complete a
larger project.

Author Steve Isaacs teaches Game Design and Development as a quest- or choice-based learning environment that provides students with opportunities to take different approaches to meeting the learning outcomes based on their own interests, in terms of content as well as project options.

Author Brian Dickman studied computer science and operates a full-time game development studio that produces entertaining and educational content inside popular video games.

## Lesson Overview

Are you a fan of soundtracks in games? Do you have music sequences that play in your head for hours after playing your favorite game? Orchestras have dedicated entire concerts to musical scores from video games. Music is impactful and memorable. Using music in your digital projects can help elevate the audience experience and make your content more engaging.

In this project, you will create a machine in Fortnite Creative to play your own custom music [loops](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#loop)!

## Desired Results

What are the learning outcomes for students?

### ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS/BIG IDEAS

Can students learn computer science concepts as part of a meaningful activity rather than simply learning syntax as an isolated skill?

Will learning computer science concepts like loops through an activity in Fortnite Creative generalize to understanding the concept in a coding environment?

Will students gain an appreciation for music composition in the context of game development?

Will students show more motivation to learn computer science when the concepts are introduced in a game environment?

### LEARNING OUTCOMES/OBJECTIVES

The student will be able to:

- Demonstrate an understanding of loops as a computer science concept
- Apply an understanding of loops as a means of musical composition in the context of a game
- Create a looping musical score as background music in a game

## Learning Activities

### Introduction to Loops

In computer science, a **loop** is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things.

– from [techterms.com](https://techterms.com/definition/loop)

For example, if you are on a track that is a quarter mile in length, and want to run a mile, you would run around the track four times. This is an example of a loop. Once you have run around the track four times, you can stop.

**Pseudocode** is a way of writing coding concepts in a simple format that is easy for people to communicate and understand. The actual code in different programming languages will have different rules (or syntax), but pseudocode allows us to think about the code based on what we are trying to accomplish.

Here is an example of a loop written in pseudocode.

Repeat 4 Times {
Run around the track
}

Here are simple videos that explain how loops work in computer science.

- [Mark Zuckerberg Explains Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlXtMr7ge9Q)

Loops can be used in any coding language, and in environments like Fortnite Creative where you can set up a scenario that creates a loop to repeat a command either infinitely or for a specified number of times.

### Activity

Students will create a looping musical score using the [Sequencer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-pulse-trigger-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and music blocks in Fortnite Creative.

The Sequencer in Fortnite Creative is a handy device that allows us to create a repeating sequence of events. In addition to running a sequence itself, the device has other attributes that give even more control of how it is used in the game.

The Sequencer can be set to have a three-dimensional volume (width x height x length). When the Sequencer is activated, it will send a pulse from the beginning of the volume to the end. This pulse will trigger any devices or objects in its path. We will use this to play music by placing music blocks inside the Sequencer volume.

The **MusicBlock Gallery** is a collection of building blocks that are labeled as music notes in a
wide array of instruments. These blocks will play the notes when triggered. This gallery contains a
plethora of colored-based tiles/blocks for each instrument type. Each block is labeled with
the note that it will play. This makes it easier to construct a song just by knowing the notes.

Refer to the Student Guide and Teacher Notes for the step-by-step directions for the activity.

Students should access and work from the Student Guide.

Use the downloadable rubric to assess student work.
