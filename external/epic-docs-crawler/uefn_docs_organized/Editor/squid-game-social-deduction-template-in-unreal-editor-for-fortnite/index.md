Choose your allies wisely, and plan your strategy as you make your way through the **Social Deduction** template. Betrayal is at the heart of the core themes expressed in **Squid Game**. Oftentimes, through the lens of social deduction or deception.

The Social Deduction template sets up those situations between players, sowing the seeds of deception and suspicion. This can pair well with your [mini-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#mini-game) content, as it adds an extra layer of distrust and the unknown between players.

Disguise Device Gameplay

Playing with social hierarchy is another way to deepen suspicion and deception. For example, players spawning in as guards could be more powerful than players spawning in as contestants through the [Class Selector](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-class-selector-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device, which would naturally lead to asymmetric play. However, the threat of a mob of contestants ganging up on and overpowering the guards could be just as powerful as the threat of a single guard’s weapon.

Use this guide as a companion to the template to dive deeper into the following:

- Experiences centered around social connections, deception, and betrayal.
- Settings for hero devices.
- Squid Game feature set.

## Getting Started

The learning template is available only in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).

To access the template:

1. Open **UEFN**.
2. In the **Project Browser**, click **Brand Templates > Squid Game > Social Deduction**.
3. Create a new project.

To learn more about creating a project and using Island Templates for Squid Game Islands, see [Game Collections](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/game-collections-in-fortnite).

To get the best experience from the template, use the editor and an instance of the Fortnite game client (session) together. From the Fortnite session, you can play the games and read the in-editor guides.

Use the [Outliner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#outliner-panel) to help navigate to the rooms and see all the assets used to design the room.

## Loading Room

Enter right into the Squid Game world with a theme loading room. Go through each labeled door to learn more about each mechanic and theme. Each room starts with a tutorial corridor followed by a game example.

[![Squid Game Social Deduction Game Rooms in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e56ac4d5-e7ae-4198-aa8e-98afa3863496?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e56ac4d5-e7ae-4198-aa8e-98afa3863496?resizing_type=fit)

Social Deduction Game Rooms

Learn to create new interactions between players to unlock different ways to connect and tell more interesting stories. Each room focuses on a particular device that captures the theme of Squid Game.

Who can we trust? Is everyone around us who they really say they are? Appearances can be deceiving, especially with the Disguise device. Anonymity, such as hiding nameplates, can encourage risky behavior, and the will of an anonymous mob can be chaotic, frightening, and dangerous. Betrayal could strike at any turn.

| Room (Device) | Gameplay |
| --- | --- |
| **Disguise Device** | Blend in with a group of nonplayer characters (NPCs), by using disguises to avoid detection from the sniper.  As the sniper, find the player amongst the NPCs. You have limited ammo, so choose wisely. |
| **Voting Device** | Use the voting devices to answer correctly or face the consequences. Players, even when confident, can begin to doubt themselves when seeing other players choose different answers.  Includes a Verse example in the Verse level asset. |
| **Hiding Props (Giftbox)** | Time is limited, find the hiders. As a hider, use the Giftbox device to deceive seekers.  Includes a Verse example in the Verse level asset. |
| **Dynamic Team Emotes** | Swap teams using Dynamic Team Emotes and gain different inventory. |

The loading room is set up with multiple spawners and best experienced with multiplayer. You can use [multiplayer previewing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/multiplayer-previewing-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to help test out some of the rooms.

Each room uses assets from the theme galleries to capture the aesthetics of Squid Game. Keep the design elements in mind as you explore ideas for your Squid Game island. To learn more about these galleries, see [Working With Squid Game Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-squid-game-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
