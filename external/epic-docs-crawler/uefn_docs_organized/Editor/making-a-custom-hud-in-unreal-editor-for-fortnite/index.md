To create your own custom [heads-up display (HUD)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hud), learn how to use Viewmodel in Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) and follow this tutorial. These teach you how to create your own avatar backplates and make a custom squad view, including health and shield bars. For this tutorial you'll need:

- [Custom UI Material Instances](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-custom-ui-with-material-instances-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).
- The UI Material Lab texture pack.
- Any textures you want to use as part of your UI materials.

Creating your own HUD means using Creative devices to control the look of the HUD through the **[HUD Controller](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-hud-controller-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** device. This provides a way for you to turn off the parts of the default Fortnite HUD you don’t want to use and to add a custom **User Widget** to the device with your own HUD design.

You can also control the HUD in Verse. See **[Removing and Controlling the Fortnite Default HUD](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/removing-and-controlling-the-fortnite-default-hud-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite)** to learn more.

To learn more about setting up a **User Widget** for the different UI HUD elements in UMG, refer to the [UI Pop-Ups](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/ui-popups-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) documentation.
