The first room in the [Minigame Mastery](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/squid-game-minigame-mastery-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) template focuses on the **Progress Based Mesh** device. This room is less of a game example and more of a quick demo for setting up the device. With a surprise at the end.

Progress Based Mesh Device Room

You can use the device to visually show how well a player is doing in the [mini-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#mini-game) or mimic the action of players adding objects to an item.

## Progress Based Mesh Device

The room demonstrates the settings for the Progress Based Mesh device, as well as setting up the device to grow a tree to reach new heights. The primary settings are the progression values. In Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), you can add your own meshes, visual, and sound effects.

Progress Based Mesh Device User Options

The Progress Based Mesh device is available for all Fortnite islands in Creative and UEFN, but is especially useful for Squid Game islands. In the template, you can find the device in the **Content Drawer**, under **All > Fortnite > Devices > Environment**.

To learn more about the device and settings, see [Progress Based Mesh Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-progress-based-mesh-devices-in-fortnite).

Use the [Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device at the end of the learning corridor to grow the tree. The meshes switch out until the tree is grown.
The list of meshes are known as the threshold meshes. The tree starts out as a pile of dirt and completes as a full tree with climbable ledges.

Threshold Meshes Options

To match the theme better, you can use a crop watering mechanic rather than a simple button press.

Available only in the Squid Game Feature set is the Llama Bank device. The device is a reskin of the Progress Based Mesh device. This means the settings are the same, but the prop is designed to fit the aesthetic of the Squid Game brand and connect fans to iconic props seen in the show.

## The CTL Doll Setup

Just as you complete your progress, you are met with a surprise. The **Cuddle Team Leader (CTL) doll** is part of the Squid Game feature set as a prop. To rotate the head you can use the [Prop Mover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prop-mover-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [Cinematic Sequence](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-cinematic-sequence-device-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) devices.

## Design Tips

Below are additional design considerations:

- Track progress of a game. You can use the Squid Game version of the device to make use of the Llama Bank.
- Provide players an award or surprise for completing progress.
- Build platformer games that change over time or reveal new platforms based on progression in the game.
