When working in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), you can access Fab directly to acquire and download plugins and assets for your project, by using the Fab window. This works similarly to accessing [Fab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fab/fab-documentation) through your browser, but there are some differences.

## Accessing Fab

To access Fab in UEFN, navigate to the **Window** menu, and scroll down to **Fab** in the Get Content section.

[![the Fab window can be opened from the Window menu.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d5906c90-4a77-4a7a-b016-a1ae9fbcc798?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d5906c90-4a77-4a7a-b016-a1ae9fbcc798?resizing_type=fit)

Click to enlarge image.

Alternatively, you can open the **Content Browser**, then click on the **Fab** button right next to the **Save All** button.

[![Fab can be opened from the Content Browser as well.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0100808b-6c97-4a0f-b913-40e071e866d6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0100808b-6c97-4a0f-b913-40e071e866d6?resizing_type=fit)

Click to enlarge image.

The Fab window is enabled in UEFN by default.

## Fab Products

The Fab window provides a way for you to find, view, and evaluate product listings, so that you can acquire these products for use in your projects in UEFN. Product listings can be either free or priced. You can interact with listings both as product tiles in the Fab window, and by clicking the product tiles to view the full listing.
