The **User Interface Feature Template** showcases what’s possible when creating custom [user interfaces (UI)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#ui) with [Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/umg-best-practices-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.5). You can find this template in the **Project Templates** section of the **Feature Examples** in the **Project Browser**.

This companion tutorial will familiarize you with Fortnite Creative devices that add custom a UI to the [heads up display (HUD)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#hud), how to build UI widgets from design to device functionality, and how the materials, textures, and material functions in the feature template were used to create the custom look of the UI samples.

UI sample content is packaged in the [Content Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#content-browser) in the **UI folder**, then by device in the **Devices folders**. Each device folder contains the following asset folders:

- **Material Instances** - Materials and material functions used to create either a flat UI design or a dynamic design.
- **Textures** - Textures used to create a more complicated UI design not possible with materials alone.
- **Widgets** - The User Widget design and construction that replaces the default player UI.

The template is divided into three halls. Each hall has a series of rooms that feature different devices and UI examples. Bookmarks are set up to take you from room to room where you will learn about different Creative devices, how they are used to display a custom UI, and to view the UI samples created for those devices.

Press these keys to select a new room in the template:

- **1** - Room 1
- **2** - Room 2
- **3** - Room 3, Room 5, Room 6
- **4** - Room 4

Get started by pressing the **1 key** to go to the first hallway and enter Room 1 where you’ll begin learning about the HUD Message and Pop-Up Dialog devices and their widgets. Enter each room to see examples of devices, UI, and more. The documentation below will help you to understand how these examples were set up and how you can make your own custom UI.
