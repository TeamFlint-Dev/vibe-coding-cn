## Class Information

- **Grade:** 8 (students must be 13 or older to participate in this class)
- **Lesson timeframe:** Four 45-minute class periods, depending on student familiarity with Fortnite Creative
- **Featured tool:** Fortnite Creative
- **Class / learning environment:** A Fortnite-capable device with a one-to-one device-to-student ratio, and with Internet connectivity. A computer lab or mobile laptop cart should provide the ideal environment.

The classroom or lab has one computer per student that can run Fortnite Creative Island. Rensselaer City School District is a small public school consisting of one pK–12 building. My current learning environment is a science classroom with tables for 24 students and six lab tables. I have four sections of eighth grade science with class sizes of 19 to 27 pupils. We are classified as a high-needs district. I also have ELL students and students with IEPs enrolled in the classes I teach.
The learning environment for this lesson requires computers or mobile devices able to run
Fortnite Creative. Other than that requirement, any classroom would work, particularly for the extension activity.

## Lesson Overview

Colliding objects offer a prime opportunity to explore the laws of physics. Fortnite Creative features collisions, making it an excellent way to experiment with the basic principles of physics, including Newton’s third law.

**Newton’s Laws of Motion**

1. An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
2. The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force applied.
3. Whenever one object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first.

Exactly how well do the physics in Fortnite replicate those found in real life? Do the game’s physics support Newton’s third law regarding the forces of action and reaction? Let’s find out!

In this lesson, students will design an experiment to manipulate objects, measure object interactions, and draw conclusions about Newton’s third law by bashing objects together.

Through this activity, students will:

- Design a solution to a problem.
- Model interactions before and after a collision.
- Collect evidence and make claims based on evidence.
- Compare and contrast real world and video game physics.

Let’s start smashing!

## DESIRED RESULTS

### ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS/BIG IDEAS

How can the behavior of objects during collisions be predictable? How well do the physics of Fortnite match those of real -life?

### LEARNING OUTCOMES/OBJECTIVES

Students will learn how to:

- Design a controlled experiment.
- Describe collisions in terms of Newton’s third and second laws.
- Make predictions about motion resulting from collisions.
- Run an experiment in Fortnite Creative.
- Analyze data.

## Lesson Plan

### LEARNING ACTIVITIES

The lesson is based on the 5E model of science instruction: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate.

Extend is an additional application of the ideas within the 5E lesson that is often included as part of the 5E model.

### ENGAGE

Students will learn about the phenomena of collisions through a variety of videos, including Newton’s Cradle and a Safety Car Crash test video.

Video 1: [Snow Collision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azMShH74mbw)

Video 2: [EYC funny snow tube collision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F72ioxnsX0s)

Video 3: [Keansburg, New Jersey's Bumper Car Psychos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh8JODtAMhc)

Video 4\*: [BUMPER CARS For LOOT in Fortnite!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XXtIoAEvHU)

\*Note: Video 4 is a bumper car mini-game in Fortnite.

### EXPLORE

Students will explore the physics of collisions using Fortnite Creative.
Students will choose one independent variable related to the Ball Spawner to see how it changes the dependent variable. All other variables should be controlled.

### RESEARCH QUESTION

How does [independent variable] affect the distance a ball moves when colliding with another ball in Fortnite Creative?

Use the [Research Question Worksheet](https://d1iv7db44yhgxn.cloudfront.net/documentation/attachments/fe1ad9d1-47b7-4bd6-8a56-6f0a1317f99c/data-tables.pdf) to have students work through the research question provided, or as a basis to make their own. For reference, here are the ball spawner options.

[![ball spawner options](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/32ca9844-7b02-4694-b8dc-8b6cb2e04cae?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/32ca9844-7b02-4694-b8dc-8b6cb2e04cae?resizing_type=fit)

**Notes / Project Guidelines:**

- Emphasize to students that in a controlled experiment, the scientist changes only one independent variable at a time. For example, if we are testing ball size, the size of the ball that is hit will remain the same, while the size of the ball colliding with it will change (or vice versa).
- Have students create a sketch (model) of what their [device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) will look like in Fortnite.
- Students should decide all of the above BEFORE they construct their device in Fortnite.

Students should have their data table prepared before they construct their rolling device in Fortnite Creative. Students will then use Fortnite to construct their ball-rolling device and collect data using the following steps:

1. Change the ball settings under the “Customize” section of the editing menu for the ball spawner.
2. Select a “default” ball type and material to use as a control.
3. Construct a data table.
4. Place a distance marker by pressing the mouse scroll wheel from the point of origin to the location where the ball stopped.
5. Compute the average distance the ball travels for each parameter.
6. Graph the data to use as evidence for the conclusion.

Balls may continue to move in Fortnite until they hit an object and may only seem to “stop”. Students should look for that moment when the ball “stops.”

### EXPLAIN

Students will explain the physics by submitting a lab report and video of their research. The student’s explanation will be noted in the Claim, Evidence, Reasoning (CER) section of their report.

### EVALUATE

The teacher will assess student understanding based on mastery of rubric, a lab report, and a video submission. The teacher should feel free to have students show evidence of learning in whatever way they deem appropriate. Other methods to show evidence of learning can include a blog post or website.

### EXTEND

Have students design an experiment similar to the Fortnite experiment (using the same data table) to examine how collisions behave with marbles and/or steel bearings. Students should reflect on and document differences noted between the fortnite experiment and the physical experiment.
