A cinematic or cutscene is a sort of short video that plays between gameplay elements in a video game. It’s an effective way to advance a game’s story and immerse players in the game world. Cinematics are also used to complement gameplay, evoke emotions, and provide background information. Cinematics can also be used to advertise islands.

Before creating a cutscene you must have invested time in level design and created gameplay and mechanics. Refer to game building basics by beginning with these documents:

- [How to Design a Game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/how-to-design-a-game-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Onboarding Players](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/onboarding-players-in-fortnite-creative)
- [Level Design Best Practices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/level-design-best-practices-in-fortnite-creative)

Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) has a suite of features to create cutscenes and animations. Refer to the **[Animation and Cinematics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/animation-and-cinematics-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite)** documentation for more information. For more in depth information about animating, refer to the **[Animating Characters and Objects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animating-characters-and-objects-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.5)** section of Unreal Engine documentation.

To create impactful cutscenes you need to use narrative elements alongside film techniques. Think about what your cinematic should communicate to the player and the best way to capture this information in a Level Sequence.

## Before You Begin

Familiarize yourself with the camera and [Sequencer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/sequencer-and-control-rig-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#creating-a-level-sequence) documentation to better understand the different camera devices and effects available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Review the [**Animation and Cinematics**](animation-and-cinematics-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) documentation for information on how to move the camera and different effects you can add to your cinematics, such as gameplay events, camera shakes, and more.

For in depth information about animation and advanced recording techniques, refer to the [Animating Characters and Objects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/animating-characters-and-objects-in-unreal-engine) section in the **Unreal Engine** documents.
