Live past the apocalypse by creating your own island within **The Walking Dead Universe** (TWDU). This brand feature set is stocked with [cool weapons](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-twdu-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#weapons), [Walker NPC](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-twdu-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#walker-np-cs), [Negan NPC](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-twdu-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#negan-npc), and [themed assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-twdu-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#galleries-and-prefabs-nbsp) so that you can create the most enticing horror-filled gameplay.

Bite into both the **Prison Starter** and **[Walker NPC templates](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/twdu-walker-npc-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite)** in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) to load preconfigured experiences that showcase the provided assets.

Within these projects, you can navigate to **Content Browser** > **All** > **The Walking Dead Universe** to access The Walking Dead Universe's curated assets to build and design your gameplay.

The Walker NPC is part of the NPC Spawner device and [NPC Character Definition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), which are only available in UEFN.

## The Walking Dead Universe Islands

Liven up your gameplay with the assets provided in TWDU's Prison Starter Island and Walker NPC templates. You can access these templates in the UEFN project browser under the **Brand Templates** tab. These templates are well-equipped with everything you'll need to craft your own gameplay experiences.

Create projects within the Prison Starter Island for a pre-designed environment to build your unique gameplay. Take advantage of the many Walker-fighting scenarios as you build your gameplay around the open cafeterias and crowded hallways.

Step into the [Walker NPC template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/twdu-walker-npc-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), and get a firsthand experience of the terrors of the Walker affliction.

Depending on your active weapon, you can toggle a [first-person](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-first-person-camera-devices-in-fortnite-creative) view to experience a personal perspective of the gameplay. This template also showcases a heavy linework [post-processing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/intro-to-postprocessing-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) effect that gives the environment a comic-book aesthetic, as well as a [custom heads-up display](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/twdu-custom-hud-vitals-and-selected-item-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) (HUD) that shows a player's vitals and their selected item.

Alternatively, you can access TWDU content from starter islands in the UEFN Project Browser under **Island Templates** or general grid islands in Fortnite Creative.

## Publishing Islands

Any island you publish within TWDU must have an age-appropriate rating. The TWDU template islands and [Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creator-portal-overview-in-fortnite-creative) are set up to guide you through this process. As a general rule, create your island with all audiences in mind.

The table below shows each Rating Authority, region, and age-appropriate rating for an island within The Walking Dead Universe.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rating Authority** | **Region** | **Maximum Age Rating Category** |
| [ESRB](https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide) | North America | T |
| [PEGI](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean) | Europe & UK | 12 |
| [ACB](https://www.classification.gov.au/classification-ratings/what-do-ratings-mean) | Australia | M |
| [Classlnd](https://www.gov.br/mj/pt-br/assuntos/seus-direitos/classificacao-1) | Brazil | 12 |
| [USK](https://usk.de/die-usk-alterskennzeichen) | Germany | 16 |

| [IARC General](https://www.globalratings.com/ratings-guide.aspx) | Rest of World | 12 |

Publishing an island from TWDU follows the same process as publishing any other Fortnite Creative island through the Creator Portal. To learn more about the publishing process within UEFN, refer to [Publishing Projects](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-projects-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

For more information about publishing TWDU islands, check out the [Brand and Creator Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/the-walking-dead-universe-brand-and-creator-rules-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) page.

## Walker NPCs

Say hello to the [Walkers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/twdu-configuring-walker-npcs-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), which are slow-moving enemy [NPCs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) that can be overwhelming in large numbers.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/447c7c18-393e-4977-8a9b-0cd5e7c79396?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/447c7c18-393e-4977-8a9b-0cd5e7c79396?resizing_type=fit)

Be careful! Walkers tend to group up and attack you together, so plan your fights strategically. If bitten by a Walker your health will decrease over time, and you will eventually be eliminated.

Aim for the head! Walkers take additional damage from headshots and fire damage.

To create the Walker NPC, you must use UEFN to access the [NPC Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [NPC Character Definition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).  To learn more about creating the NPC, see [Configuring Walkers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/twdu-configuring-walker-npcs-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

## Negan NPC

Add backup to your islands with the Negan NPC from TWDU comic books. Get started with Negan patrolling your islands with the [Guard Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/guard-spawner-device) in UEFN and Creative.

[![Negan NPC for The Walking Dead Universe in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/262bff40-ce6e-4fbf-b555-98b41ec0a731?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/262bff40-ce6e-4fbf-b555-98b41ec0a731?resizing_type=fit)

To use Negan in the Guard Spawner device, from the Details panel or Creative menu for the device, use the **Character Cosmetic** dropdown. To equip Negan with his beloved [Lucille](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-twdu-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#lucille) using the device, go to **Details panel >** **Item List**, and click the plus icon.

You can also place Negan in your islands with either the [NPC Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-spawner-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) through a [Character Definition](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-npc-character-definitions-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) or the [Character device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-character-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

## Weapons

Meet the
**Shiva Shotgun** and **Lucille** bat, your go-to weapons for boss battling large groups of Walkers. Enjoy the custom visual effects attached to these weapons as you slay your way to victory.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b5423414-57c3-4aea-bf73-a4e088f6327d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b5423414-57c3-4aea-bf73-a4e088f6327d?resizing_type=fit)

### Shiva Shotgun

Clear out Walkers with the Shiva Shotgun. This magazine-fed shotgun launches explosive shells when charged up. Charged shots roar out and deal area-of-effect (AoE) damage as they explode, clearing out hordes of enemies. The shotgun is modified with a flashlight to help you navigate the dark. Aim (target) with the shotgun to activate the flashlight.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attack** | **Description** |
| **Primary Fire** | Press the trigger input to fire the weapon. |
| **Secondary Fire** | Press and hold the trigger input to fire an explosive round. |

### Lucille

You can whip out the Lucille baseball bat for an up-close and personal melee attack. You can use Lucille for the following attacks.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attack** | **Description** |
| **Swing** | Perform quick, low-damage attacks. |
| **Heavy Swing** | Perform a wide sweep attack with heavy damage that knocks back both players and NPCs. Hold to enter a "windup" state. |
| **Slam Attack** | Perform a large, overhead slam that deals an AoE damage and knockback. |

To learn more about incorporating these weapons into your island, see [The Walking Dead Universe Weapons](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/the-walking-dead-universe-weapons-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

## Galleries and Prefabs

These templates contain the assets you need to design your own rendition of TWDU. Browse through the **Galleries** and **Prefabs** folder within the **Content Browser**, and fill your project with assets and props to create breathtaking environments.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a0a23b11-74cb-4871-b613-ea1f6b925f80?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a0a23b11-74cb-4871-b613-ea1f6b925f80?resizing_type=fit)

Within the **Galleries**folder, you can browse through individual building pieces, such as roof and wall assets, to create original environments. You can then create an eerie atmosphere with assets from the **Props**folder.

You can open the **Galleries** folder to find the assets in the table below.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
| **TWDU Prison Floor and Stair Gallery** | **TWDU Prison Roof Gallery** | **TWDU Prison Wall Gallery** | **TWDU Prison Prop Gallery** |

Save time by placing pre-designed structures in the **Prefabs** folder. These structures are packaged with pre-placed props that are designed to fit the prefab's theme.
