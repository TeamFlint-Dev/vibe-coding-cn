The **Conversation device** in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)** is a powerful tool that lets you build dynamic and interactive game modes. With this device, you can script conversation trees with NPCs, allowing players to make choices that directly influence the gameplay. These choices can trigger in-game events, alter objectives, or modify the storyline, giving players a sense of control and providing the power for a player to shape the overall experience.

The Conversation device is essential for crafting narrative-driven or choice-based modes in UEFN, giving flexibility to design interactions that adapt and respond to player input in real-time.
