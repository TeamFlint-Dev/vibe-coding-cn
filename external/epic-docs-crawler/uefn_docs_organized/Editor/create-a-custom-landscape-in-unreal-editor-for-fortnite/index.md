Creating custom terrain is easy with [Landscape Mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/landscape-mode-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) tools. Landscape Mode tools can be used on either a blank [island template](sample-projects-and-templates-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to build custom terrain from scratch, or to sculpt existing terrain on a populated island.

This tutorial is broken into sections that cover the essential elements required to construct a unique terrain. Each section explores a different set of tools and how they work.

Playtest your island often to make sure that the terrain is playable and works for the type of experience you’re creating.

## Overview

By following these tutorials, you’ll learn to construct terrain, work with the water tools, create caves, lay down roads and paths, and use foliage to make your island feel more alive and real.
