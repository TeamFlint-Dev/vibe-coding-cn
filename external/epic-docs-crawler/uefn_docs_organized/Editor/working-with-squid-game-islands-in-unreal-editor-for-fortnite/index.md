Ready to play for keeps? You can now create Fortnite islands with assets and content from **Squid Game** using Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative!

You can use Squid Game-themed devices, island templates, props, galleries, and NPCs to create a Squid Game-inspired gameplay experience. It's all ready for you to create high-stakes challenges masked as childhood games.

Create puzzles and conundrums for your players. Think of the simple games of your childhood, and try to use their nostalgic facade to hide the twists and turns you’re setting up for your players!

## Squid Game Template Islands

You can start building Squid Game islands with three new project templates in UEFN, under the **Brand Templates** tab. Here's a list of the new Squid Game island templates you can use:

- **Squid Game Starter Island** (UEFN only)
- **Minigames Mastery Template** (UEFN only)
- **Social Deduction Template** (UEFN only)

### Squid Game Starter Island

### Other Ways to Create Squid Game Islands

You can also make a Squid Game Island using any starter island on the **Island Templates** tab in UEFN, and selecting **Squid Game** from the **Brand** dropdown. In Creative, you can build a Squid Game island using the **Squid Game Flat Grid** starter island, or the **Squid Game XL Flat Grid** starter island.

After you create your island, you will have access to Squid Game curated assets to build and design your gameplay. The feature set includes assets like Squid Game characters, devices, galleries, widgets, audio, and more. You can access the feature set in the respective Squid Game folder in UEFN and Creative.

## Publishing Islands

To publish Squid Game islands, you must be a member of the [Island Creator Program](https://create.fortnite.com/enroll) and you’ll need to opt into additional terms and conditions in the [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome), which confirm you’ll agree to share 15% of your engagement payout for Squid Game islands with Netflix (see [fee schedule](https://create.fortnite.com/news/ip-partner-fee-schedule)). If you’ve already opted into the terms and conditions to publish other IP islands (like The Walking Dead Universe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles), you don't need to do this again for Squid Game. Your island must follow the [Squid Game Brand and Creator](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/squid-game-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite) rules.

## IARC Audience Restrictions

Any Squid Game islands that you create must have an age-appropriate rating. The Creator Portal is set up to guide you through this process, as part of the island publishing workflow. As a general rule, you should create your island with all audiences in mind.

The table below shows each Rating Authority and region, and their age-appropriate rating for a Squid Game island.

| Rating Authority | Region | Maximum Age Rating Category |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [ESRB](https://www.esrb.org/ratings-guide/) | North America | T |

## Squid Game Characters

You can populate your islands with Squid Game non-player characters ([NPCs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#npc)). This includes a variety of contestants wearing the iconic green jumpsuits, the pink-suited guards with three mask decal options (circle, triangle, square), a black-suited games manager, and the Front Man.

You can access these characters from the following devices:

- [Guard Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-guard-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

## Devices

There are special Squid Game versions of several devices, which you can use to enhance your Squid Game island. The **Gift Box** is a special [Hiding Prop device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-hiding-prop-gallery-devices-in-fortnite-creative) that you can customize, which has the same device options as any other hiding prop. The **Llama Bank** is a special [Progress Based Mesh device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-progress-based-mesh-devices-in-fortnite) that is ideal for a visual indicator of how successful each player is in a mini-game. The colored Gonggi shapes are special versions of the [Carryable Spawner device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-carryable-spawner-devices-in-fortnite), which you can set to explode or cause damage when it is thrown. Each Gonggi color is a separate device.

You can combine the **[Disguise Kit](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-squid-game-islands-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite#disguise-kit)** with the [Disguise device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-disguise-devices-in-fortnite), to turn players into Squid Game guards, managers, or contestants.

You can use the [Voting Group and Voting Options devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-voting-group-and-voting-options-devices-in-fortnite) to set up a voting system. Players can vote to eliminate or damage other players in tense and high-stakes scenarios!

## VIP Masks

You can use the VIP Mask props along with a special Niagara VFX system to apply the masks to your players. To see how this is done, check out the Carryable Spawner device room in the [Minigame Mastery Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/squid-game-minigame-mastery-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) in UEFN.

## Cuddle Team Leader Doll

The **Cuddle Team Leader (CTL) doll** prop is available as a control rig asset for custom animation, without using the [Prop Mover device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prop-mover-devices-in-fortnite-creative). You can find the additional doll assets under the **All > Squid Game > Doll** folder.

[![Squid Game Doll in UEFN](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/014b3e13-240a-4d54-aa95-9125afe875d6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/014b3e13-240a-4d54-aa95-9125afe875d6?resizing_type=fit)

CTL Doll Control Rig

To use the asset, drag it into your island, and a Sequencer tab should open. You can move the individual controls for the doll and keyframe them in Sequencer. With Sequencer, you can have the animation respond to events.

To learn more about animation, see [Sequencer and Control Rig](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/sequencer-and-control-rig-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), and [Gameplay Events in Sequencer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/gameplay-events-in-sequencer-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

The Doll folder also includes the following files:

1. **Physical material:** Sets how the material of a mesh dynamically responds to objects in your island.
2. **Physics asset:** The physics and collision areas for a skeletal mesh.
3. **Skeletal mesh:** A 3D mesh that is constrained to a skeleton for animation.
4. **Skeleton:** The bone hierarchy used in the skeletal mesh asset.

These are assets that support the control rig asset.

## Audio

There are various sound assets in the **Audio** and **VO** (voiceover) folders. You can use these assets to add cues for props or audio for characters. The voiceover audio includes the announcer, CTL doll, recruiter, and guard.

To learn more about using these assets, see [Audio](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/audio-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite). You can also add audio tracks in Sequencer. To learn more, see the [Audio Track](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/cinematic-audio-track-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.5) Unreal Engine documentation.
