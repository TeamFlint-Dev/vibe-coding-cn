Ready to use Verse to take your island up to the next level? Here's where you can start!

## Create Your Own Device

With Verse, you can build your own devices and your own game rules. Create a new Verse file from the **Verse Device** template in [Verse Explorer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-explorer-user-interface-reference-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to be able to add your own device to your project.

## Create Your Own NPC Behavior

With Verse, you can define your own [NPC Behavior](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/understanding-npc-behavior-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to create unique non-playable characters for your game. Create a new Verse file from the **NPC Behavior** template in [Verse Explorer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-explorer-user-interface-reference-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to create a behavior with a working example that moves around, or from the **NPC Behavior Basic** template.

## Create Your Own Verse File

Create an empty Verse file by selecting **Create Empty** in [Verse Explorer](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-explorer-user-interface-reference-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and define your own classes, [modules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/modules-and-paths-in-verse), anything you can think of!

Once you create your own definitions, incorporate them into your [Verse Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/programming-with-verse-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) or [NPC Behavior](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/programming-with-verse-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to use them in your game.
