Lighting has many uses in game design. Lighting evokes emotion and mood, helps create depth through the use of shadows, and provides other visual information. It can even provide a pathway for players to follow.

Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) uses the power of [Lumen](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#lumen) and [Virtual Shadow Maps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#virtual-shadow-map) to create softer shadows, realistic global illumination, and better overall visual experiences.

Learn how to use the different lighting tools to upgrade existing Fortnite Creative islands, or use Lumen out of the box in a new UEFN project. You can even create completely custom lighting with the Environment Lighting Rig device to have more control over how you want to light each actor in your project.

Learn how to use the lighting tools in UEFN to craft custom environments for you island with the **UEFN Advanced Lighting** videos tutorials from the Learning Library.
