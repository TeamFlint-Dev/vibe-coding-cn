You can't publish directly from **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**. Instead, you can publish your projects through the **Creator Portal** — where you can manage all aspects of publishing.

The publishing flow begins in UEFN where you review the [project size](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/project-size-tool-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [memory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/memory-management-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) before finishing the publishing workflow in the Creator Portal. Publishing a project in Creator Portal also works for Verse projects. With the Creator Portal, you can version your projects, add media, and move projects through the publishing process.

## The Publishing Process

You must be 18 years or older to publish a project.

To begin, open your project in UEFN.

1. From the **Level Editor Toolbar**, click **Launch a Session**. Once the game begins, select the editor window again and click **End Game**. This cooks all your project’s assets and provides a way to calculate your project’s total memory usage.
2. Click **Project** from the **Level Editor Toolbar** and select **Launch Memory Calculation** from the **Project** dropdown menu. A Memory Calculation pop up opens prompting you to Calculate Memory.
3. Click **Calculate Memory** in the pop up. A loading bar appears and begins to load your project’s memory.
4. Once the project finishes loading, a **Private Version** code is created for your project at this time and appears in a pop up. To use the code, click **Copy** and send this code to your team members or save in your personal files.
5. A toast message appears in the bottom right of your screen informing you that the memory calculation is complete. To view the memory budget of your project click **Show Results** in the toast message. The total memory calculation for your project opens in a new pop up message.
6. Take a screenshot of the **Memory Calculation** popup for your records. The message notifies you whether the project is within budget or not for publication. It also includes the Island Version number and the Memory Usage amount.

   1. To show this data in the Creator Portal, check the **Show in Creator Portal** box.
7. Click **Cancel** to close the pop up message.

Your project sits in an **unpublished** state until you release your project from the Creator Portal. From the Creator Portal you will:

- Add details, descriptors, and notes about your island; title, tags, and more.
- Fill out the IARC questionnaire to get a rating for your island.
- Attach your supporting media; thumbnail images, lobby background image, and videos.
- Provide attributions for any third party content you purchased and used.
- Decide the visibility of your project.
- Submit your project for moderation.

To continue the publishing workflow, see the [Publishing from the Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) document for all the important information.
