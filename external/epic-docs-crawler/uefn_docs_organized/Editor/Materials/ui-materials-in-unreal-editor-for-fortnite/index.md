Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) uses materials as a sort of paint for widgets. Materials can be used to create a cheap, dynamic looking UI widget. The tutorials in this section teach you how to use math to create a desired effect in a material through specific material nodes. You can create materials that move, glow, and much more.

For more information on creating materials with math focused material nodes, refer to the following Unreal Engine documentation:
