Jump into Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite to build The Walking Dead Universe (TWDU) islands using special templates and [assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#asset)! Working with TWDU assets and islands comes with certain responsibilities and expectations. Below are a series of guidelines for creating TWDU islands.

## Rules for Using TWDU Templates

In order to build with **The Walking Dead Universe** (TWDU) templates, there are rules you need to follow in addition to the [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and other existing agreements such as the Monetization Agreement.

### The Walking Dead Universe Brand Rules

When building using The Walking Dead Universe templates and promoting your islands that use TWDU templates you must adhere to the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, and all other relevant agreements and the following rules or you could risk experiencing the consequences discussed below.

1. **Only use The Walking Dead Universe assets in your TWDU islands.** This rule only applies to assets associated with The Walking Dead franchises. You are permitted to use assets not associated with The Walking Dead in your TWDU islands. The characters and assets we’re making available to you are only from The Walking Dead comics by Skybound. Do not use any other The Walking Dead IP from any other third party. If you use any other The Walking Dead assets than the ones provided in the TWDU toolset, your project may be subject to moderation failure and other consequences, such as DMCA takedowns.

   1. **Do not refer to The Walking Dead Universe islands as 'The Walking Dead' or 'TWD'.** If you choose to include a reference to The Walking Dead Universe islands, you can only use 'The Walking Dead Universe' or 'TWDU'.
   2. **Don’t use content that originated from the The Walking Dead TV show on AMC.** Don’t use content, characters, or other IP that exists in the The Walking Dead TV show but does not exist in the The Walking Dead Comics. For Example, characters such as Daryl, Mary, Merle, Sasha, Lizzie, Mika, Bob, T-Dog, Henry, Rick Grimes Jr, Jadis, Beth, Alden, Simon, Jerry, and Deanna only exist in the The Walking Dead TV show and are therefore prohibited in your The Walking Dead Universe islands. In addition, the use of images or characters that look like the actors in the The Walking Dead TV series is prohibited.
2. **Only use the Walker NPC customization that we’ve provided.** You can configure the look and behavior of Walkers by using the NPC Character Definition. Do not use other tools to modify the behavior, look or feel of the Walkers. That would defeat the horror element that makes The Walking Dead Universe unique and terrifying.
3. **Don’t sell or redistribute The Walking Dead Universe assets.** Do not sell, license or distribute any stand-alone assets from The Walking Dead Universe assets.
4. **TWDU islands must use TWDU content when publishing your island.** In order to be considered a TWDU island, your island must contain at least one (1) tool, device, or asset from the TWDU game collection.

The TWDU Brand Rules are enforced by Epic Games and Skybound. Skybound can report your island to Epic Games for violating the TWDU Brand Rules.

If your island is found to be violating the TWDU Brand Rules, your content will be removed, and you will not be eligible for engagement payout awards for that island. If you repeatedly violate the TWDU Brand Rules, you will lose access to the TWDU templates. Continued violation of these rules may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

### Never Use TWDU Assets With Third-Party IP

TWDU islands are already set up with the brand appropriate TWDU assets and assets you are allowed to use as part of the agreement as well as certain Epic Games owned or licensed assets. The IP Partner Licensing agreement makes clear that you cannot mix TWDU assets with other 3rd party Intellectual Property (IP), even if the owner of the IP has given their approval. You can import and use assets that you own all the rights to if they are compliant with the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, TWDU Brand Rules listed above and all other relevant agreements. You can also use other assets provided to you directly by Epic Games, excluding assets from another IP Partner Program partner (such as with LEGO® Islands).

If you violate this rule your island may not be eligible for engagement payout awards and may be removed from the ecosystem or disabled. Continued violation of this rule may lead to increasing restrictions or termination of your account.

## Monetizing TWDU Islands

Skybound is providing a limited license to their content for you to use their approved TWDU assets. This will allow you to bring an officially licensed TWDU experience into the Fortnite ecosystem, and create new types of islands for the Fortnite community. In return, you must comply with the terms of the IP Partner Licensing Agreement including the TWDU Brand Rules, and the Fortnite Island Creator Rules, Community Guidelines, and all other relevant agreements. The only approved TWDU assets and features are the ones accessed through the designated templates.

In consideration for Skybound’s license to you to use the TWDU assets to create your TWDU island, you agree to share 12% of your total island payout with Skybound. Epic Games will automatically deduct this amount from your engagement payout and distribute it to Skybound, and you will receive the remainder. You agree to this process when you agree to the IP Partner Licensing Agreement.

[In-island transactions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-in-fortnite) are currently not supported by this IP.

## Promoting your TWDU Island

When creating media for your island, reference the guidelines outlined in [Promoting Your Fortnite Island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island). Make sure images and videos accurately reflect the island or game mechanics you created and don’t copy another game or creator. Your promotion of your TWDU island must comply with the TWDU Brand Rules, [Fortnite Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules), Community Guidelines, and other relevant agreements (e.g., Section 3 of the Fortnite Island Creator Rules). The content and messaging in your promotion must be consistent with the content rules and guidelines in such rules and agreements and age appropriate for the target audience of your island.

### Your Island in Discover

In the Creator Portal, TWDU islands are automatically tagged with “The Walking Dead Universe” during the publishing process for a special tag that will appear in the product details page.

Creator-made TWDU islands will show up in Discover and are searchable, like any other Fortnite island.
