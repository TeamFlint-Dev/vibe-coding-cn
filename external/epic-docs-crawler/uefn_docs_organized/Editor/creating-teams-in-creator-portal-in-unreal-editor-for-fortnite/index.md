The **Creator Portal** provides a way for you to form collaborative teams of developers and creators that can work together on shared UEFN projects.

With the **UEFN teams feature**, you can set clear roles and responsibilities, have different team members working on different features at the same time, and track changes and versions of shared projects.

These collaborative UEFN projects can also be published through the Creator Portal.

## Setting Up Teams and Assigning Roles

Team members can have different roles depending on the project, so assign roles according to each one’s strengths, and the permissions you want to grant them. Teams have a maximum number of 30 members.

To invite others to a team, you will go through an age verification process that includes providing the email address used with your Epic account.

You must be over 18 to invite other creators to a team, or accept an invite to join another creator’s team.
