Viewmodel is natively a part of Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Viewmodel is used to control player information. To do this, the Viewmodel has a number of functions in UEFN.

- Viewmodel provides a way to bind the function of a device to a UMG widget to replace default Fortnite UI elements.
- Provides a way to show materials and textures in UI elements.

By adding [materials](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#material) to a viewmodel you can animate the material in your UI, surround the material in a texture container, or use the material on its own to provide a dynamic flat look to your UI.

The documentation in this section explains how to use Viewmodel to show materials, textures, and set materials.

For a deeper dive into Viewmodel, refer to [**UMG Viewmodel**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/umg-viewmodel?application_version=5.5) in Unreal Engine documentation.
