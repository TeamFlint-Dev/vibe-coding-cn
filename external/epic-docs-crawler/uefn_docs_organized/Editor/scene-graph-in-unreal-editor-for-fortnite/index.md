Scene Graph is a unified structure that connects all the objects in the world. Think of it as a toolbox that contains all the tools you need for set dressing, gameplay systems, audio, VFX, and much more, to create experiences for the metaverse.

Building with Scene Graph means you can perform operations on related objects in your project. You can also use Scene Graph to duplicate and iterate on structures and code as you create them. You can even turn the objects you create into reusable [prefabs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#prefab), and use them across different projects.

Scene Graph is a Verse native system that takes advantage of Verse characteristics. This provides a way for you to add more customization to your projects with interactive, custom-built objects and gameplay experiences.
