This tutorial is a companion document to the **Day Sequence** template island, and explains how to use the **[Day Sequence Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-day-sequence-devices-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite)** to create diverse, art-driven environment designs for your project.

The template was designed to demonstrate how to use the Day Sequence device and [Post Processing Volumes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#post-process-volume) (PPV) available in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) in numerous ways to create different types of environments. This is accomplished by using the Day Sequence device to control the art direction of the Time of Day Manager.

The template island used here is split into quadrants that contain small biomes (environmental settings). Each biome is as simple as possible to focus on the lighting. You can find the **Day Sequence** template in the **Feature Examples** section of the **Project Browser**.

Before exploring the island, open the **DaySeq\_EnvLook** folder to see how the basic environmental look was established. Quadrants are packaged in the Outliner so you can easily search and filter Post Process Volumes, props, static meshes, and set dressing that make the biome. The quadrants are named:

- North
- South
- East
- West

Walk through each biome and look at how the different environment lighting and settings complement the environmental assets and create the unique look and feel of each quadrant. No custom assets were created. All of these assets are available in UEFN.
