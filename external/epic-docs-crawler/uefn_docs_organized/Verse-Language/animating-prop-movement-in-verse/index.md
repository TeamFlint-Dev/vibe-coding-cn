Obstacle courses are a staple of the platforming genre. Players jump, dodge, duck, and weave to be the first to make it to the end and claim the victory. Fall Guys brings that classic experience to UEFN, and provides the perfect opportunity to build an obstacle course, your way!

But to build an obstacle course, you first need one thing — obstacles!

A game would be too easy if your players could just run to the end with nothing between them and the finish line, so you want to add obstacles to slow them down.

There are lots of things you can do with static obstacles, but what if you could also get them moving? By moving, rotating, and even scaling your obstacles during gameplay, you can create all kinds of unique and exciting platforming challenges. Verse provides the tool to make those ideas a reality. Through the power of Verse, you can get your props moving and create an action-packed course for your players to compete in!

In this guide, you’ll learn how to create a platformer based on Fall Guys. You’ll write Verse scripts to create custom props that move using animations. You’ll then use those props in level to create custom obstacles and build your own Fall Guys course!
