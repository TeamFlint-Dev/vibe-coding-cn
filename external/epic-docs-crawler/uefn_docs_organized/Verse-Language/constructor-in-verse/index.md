A constructor is a special [function](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary) that creates an [instance](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#instance) of the [class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary) that it’s associated with. It can be used to set initial [values](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#value) for the new [object](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#object).

You can add a constructor for a class by adding the constructor specifier on the function name. Instead of specifying a return type on the function, the function is assigned the class name followed by any initialization of fields. A class can have more than one constructor.

Instead of specifying a return [type](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#type) on the function, the function is assigned the class name followed by any initialization of [fields](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#member). A class can have more than one constructor. |
| ```verse MakeOtherClass1<constructor>(Arg1 : int) := class1:     let:         OnePlusArg1 := Arg1 + 1      block:         DoSomething(OnePlusArg1)      Property1 := OnePlusArg1      block:``` | **Adding variables and executing code in the constructor:** You can execute expressions within a constructor with the [block](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/block-in-verse) expression, and introduce new variables with the keyword `let`. |
| ```verse MakeClass1Plus1<constructor>(Arg1 : int) := class1:     MakeClass1<constructor>(Arg1 + 1) # Note use of <constructor> on invocation  # The base type constructor can be invoked in any order with respect to properties, # but the properties "win" MakeOtherClass2<constructor>(Arg1 : int, Arg2 : int) := class2:     Property2 := Arg2     MakeClass1<constructor>(Arg1)     # Note that effects are still ordered as they appear in the code``` | **Calling other constructors in a constructor:** You can call other constructors from a constructor. You can also call constructors for the superclass of the class from a constructor of the class as long as all fields are initialized. When a constructor calls another constructor and both constructors initialize fields, only the values provided to the first constructor are used for the fields. The order of [evaluation](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#evaluate) for [expressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#expression) between the two constructors will be in the order the expressions are written (as far as side effects are concerned), but only the values provided to the first constructor are used. |
