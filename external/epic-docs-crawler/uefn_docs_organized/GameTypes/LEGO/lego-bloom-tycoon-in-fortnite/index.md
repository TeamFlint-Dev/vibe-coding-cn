Sprout a new world with the **LEGO® Bloom Tycoon** template in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). The template showcases how to use a grid placement system for players to spawn props individually or in a plot for your LEGO Islands. You can create a myriad of new gameplay possibilities or add this to your existing experiences.

The feature opens the possibility for you to:

- Add creative build areas in your existing or new island.
- Add timed growing areas.
- Have players gain extra experience for building specific props in specific areas.
- And more!

The grid placement system is separate from the editor's [level grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-grid-snapping-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) in the viewport. The system for the template tracks where players can and can't place props in your world.

This template includes two level assets that use different configurations of the grid system: **LEGO Bloom Tycoon** and **Brick Builder**. You can access the levels and additional assets under your project folder in the **Content Drawer**.

Template Assets

The LEGO Bloom Tycoon level focuses on a park building experience, you’ll work with Park Ranger Peely to decorate the park. This example shows how you can use the LEGO Grid device with other UEFN devices to create customizable areas with persistence per player in a multiplayer environment.

In LEGO Brick Builder, you can free build using the grid system with two building modes: **Mosaic** or **Brick Building**.

This template also includes new galleries, showcasing a range of new props and prefabs. To learn more about these assets, see [LEGO Asset Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-asset-inventory-in-fortnite-creative).
