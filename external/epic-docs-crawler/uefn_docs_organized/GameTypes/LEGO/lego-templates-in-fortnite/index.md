Welcome to your one-stop hub for LEGO Island templates in Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). You can use these templates as starting points to build, experiment, and launch [LEGO Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#lego-island) in Fortnite.

### LEGO Templates

LEGO templates provide a way for you to begin building your own LEGO Islands in Fortnite. You can use templates to start building from an empty island or from prebuilt islands designed with LEGO [assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#asset), and [gameplay](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#gameplay) systems already configured.

For a deeper look at how LEGO Islands function and how to integrate templates into your own projects, see [Working with LEGO® Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-lego-islands-in-fortnite-creative).

### Starter Island Templates

Starter islands are open environments designed for creators who want to begin from scratch. These templates do not include gameplay mechanics.

The following starter islands are brand templates specifically designed for LEGO Islands.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Template** | **Description** | **Example** |
| **Starter Island** | A tropical archipelago theme island. Use this template to mix and match LEGO and Fortnite assets for the ultimate island-hopping adventure. |  |
| **LEGO Brick Grid Island** | A starter template designed to represent the LEGO brick grid. Use the grid to visualize how studs will line up. |  |
| **LEGO® Ninjago® Starter** | An art template that provides a visual base to build a stylish and dynamic NINJAGO island. This art template includes points of interest, audio, and NINJAGO-themed modular pieces constructed from the LEGO® Brick Editor.  With the brick-built modules, you can reassemble, add to, or use them in ways that enhance your creativity, within the brand guidelines. |  |

You can find more templates in the **Island Templates** tab from the UEFN Project Browser, and use the **Brand Selection** dropdown to create a LEGO Island. To learn more about accessing brand-specific templates and content, see [Accessing Brand Content](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/accessing-brand-content-in-fortnite).

### Learning and Gameplay Templates

Learning and gameplay templates are interactive experiences that can include [billboard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#billboard) instructions, devices, and example systems built with LEGO assets.

They are designed to help you learn through play, by exploring how interactive elements are assembled and configured.

For steps on how to access and create LEGO Islands, see the Create Your Own LEGO Island section of [LEGO Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/building-lego-islands-in-fortnite).

Using a template doesn’t lock you in, feel free to disable or remove parts you don’t need.
