Welcome to the **LEGO® Home Builder** template, where you’ll play, discover, and learn how to build your own house — or town! Aim for the stars and you'll reach the moon, but first you have to imagine it!

Home Builder walks you through simple Fortnite workflows to show you how to build on your [island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#island). Once you're familiar with the basics, you can use what’s already in the template, or delete everything and start from scratch.

[![The spawn point on Home Builder.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7a0ba4b0-6b50-42c5-b9ae-53242a8c207d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7a0ba4b0-6b50-42c5-b9ae-53242a8c207d?resizing_type=fit)

There are slight differences with a LEGO Island. Some Fortnite [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) are unavailable and some building settings are hidden. To learn more, refer to **[Working with LEGO® Islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-lego-islands-in-fortnite-creative)**.

## Playing Home Builder

This template isn’t meant to be played like a [mini-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Think of Home Builder as a [sandbox](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#sandbox-game) where you can build the island of your dreams using LEGO [assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#asset)! So go ahead, create with abandon and dance like no one is watching!

Notice how tiny the homes are in the Home Builder template! They’ve shrunk to [LEGO® Minifigure](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) size! Go into the classic Fortnite homes and check out the mini-sized world. Do you see the LEGO [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) combined with the Fortnite props?

[![Example of a Minifigure standing outside different prefab homes.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d00c5838-0393-4219-8b5f-10eb79bfe4ec?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d00c5838-0393-4219-8b5f-10eb79bfe4ec?resizing_type=fit)

In the Home Builder [template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#template-island) billboards line the streets with helpful tips about the environment and tasks for you to perform, such as when to equip and activate the [Phone tool](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#phone). The Phone tool is what you use to copy, paste, place, and delete objects on the island.

[![Mix and match Fortnite and LEGO assets.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3e047597-2967-4ffa-b6d0-0ad3a29ec50b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3e047597-2967-4ffa-b6d0-0ad3a29ec50b?resizing_type=fit)

You’ll arrive at an empty lot where you’ll be prompted to toggle to the Content tab to find a [prefab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prefab) and add it to your Quick Bar.

You’ll find all the LEGO assets and more under the Content tab.

You can select and place a LEGO prefab from the [Quick Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#quick-bar) into the template. You’ll also learn how to rotate, snap, and place objects with the [Create mode hotkey menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) on the left.

If you’ve never built on a Fortnite Creative island before, there are a few resources available to help you learn how to use the [Creative Toolset](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#creative-toolset).

- **[Video tutorials](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-video-tutorials)** show you how to use the Phone tool and work on a Fortnite island.
- **[Build Your First Island in Fortnite](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/build-your-first-island-in-fortnite)** provides you with information you’ll need to understand Fortnite building language, and the UEFN user interface.

## Customizing Your Home Builder Island

Part of the fun of this template is deleting everything and rebuilding the island. You can mix and match LEGO assets with Fortnite assets, or use only LEGO content on the island. Your island, your choice!

[![An example of a LEGO Island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a2e1e4d8-151a-4323-9789-65a18900502d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a2e1e4d8-151a-4323-9789-65a18900502d?resizing_type=fit)

There are a few building conditions unique to LEGO Islands and assets:

- LEGO assets cannot overlap each other.
- LEGO assets cannot be [scaled](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#scale) or resized in any way.
- Fortnite walls, floors, roofs and stairs also cannot be scaled or resized.

The [grid snap](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid-snap) feature won’t let you overlap LEGO assets. When you attempt to place two LEGO walls next to each other, the editor automatically adds a space for a pillar. If you do overlap LEGO assets, the object you placed will crumble into a pile of bricks and disappear.

In UEFN you can overlap [LEGO Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#lego-elements), but this will cause your island to fail Epic's moderation process.

Pillar props are placed between LEGO walls and roof pieces to keep your LEGO buildings consistent with Fortnite building props and the LEGO [grid](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grid) scale.

Fortnite walls, floors, roofs and stairs overlap as expected, but you can’t resize these assets to make the Minifigure seem like a giant when you're on a LEGO Island.

You’ll notice these building constraints when you have a Fortnite building prop or LEGO asset attached to your Phone tool. Select a LEGO asset then check out the Hotkey menu on the left. You won't see the option to scale because it's hidden!

All Fortnite houses, castles, and other prefabs are the same size as the grid on LEGO template islands, 0.5 [Unreal Units](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#unreal-units). This means players can easily enter any building with their Minifigure.

LEGO props are treated the same as Fortnite props. The only difference is Fortnite props can be scaled with the Phone tool. You can make Fortnite props smaller or bigger than the Minifigure.

### Using the Quick Menu and Island Settings

LEGO Islands use the same [Quick Menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#quick-menu) options for Movement and Tools. You can [fly](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#fly-mode) your Minifigure avatar around your island and change the Phone tool’s keybindings.

Object Placement has most of Fortnite’s familiar options. The option that controls Drop is hidden. This option could be used to violate the LEGO Brand and Creator Rules.

The typical Fortnite [Island Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/island-settings-in-uefn-and-fortnite-creative) are also available on LEGO Islands. Go ahead and add camera filters, change the time of day settings and much more to create the LEGO world you want to see!

[![Use the Island Settings to further enhance your island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/84ecadaf-7a35-436d-8a4e-16ef16d87e72?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/84ecadaf-7a35-436d-8a4e-16ef16d87e72?resizing_type=fit)

You can even select to set the island back to its default state to see what it looked like before you made any changes. Select **Overview** > **Reset Island to Original State**, and like magic, you’re back where it all began.

If you want to make sure you don’t lose your changes, don’t worry, you can back up your island to keep everything in its place. Select **Overview** > **Create Backup** and you’re all set. No need to worry about the island anymore!

## On Your Own

The best part is that nothing on your island is permanent. You can always delete and try again, and again, and again until you're satisfied with your island.

So grab your Phone tool and get building!
