The LEGO® Brick Editor has arrived, bringing brick-by-brick building to LEGO Island Creators. Choose from the selection of classic LEGO bricks to create your own LEGO builds and bake them into static meshes to use in your LEGO Islands!

Think of the LEGO® Brick Editor Template as a guide to becoming a top-tier LEGO model builder. This template island reveals some of our insider tips and tricks for maximizing the impact of this tool in your creations.

To begin your brick-building journey, create a new project with the LEGO Brick Editor template. This template is slightly different as most of the experience takes place in the viewport and not in the launched experience. After all, this experience is all about building with LEGO bricks!

[![The LEGO Brick Editor template can be found under the Brand Template tile in the Project Browser.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/073c3e6e-cfe3-4dd6-ad07-f308dc38f994?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/073c3e6e-cfe3-4dd6-ad07-f308dc38f994?resizing_type=fit)

You can find the template assets in the **Content Browser** under **All** > **YOUR ISLAND NAME HERE** > **Examples**. This folder also contains all the builds used in the template, so you can browse through them if you need some extra inspiration.

Anything you kragle together while in the template also appears here.

## LEGO® Brick Editor Building Challenges

The template consists of 4 building challenges that increase in difficulty. Each challenge is designed to ramp up and let your inner creativity run wild on the playground.

Remember that for all LEGO® Brick snapping to be in effect, you should be in the **LEGO® Brick Editor mode**. This mode also helps with both validation and making sure that your builds look awesome!

To get started, look around the template at the teaching pods, and search for teaching pod 1, titled **The Duck**.

For more information about the LEGO Brick Editor mode, see **[Working with the LEGO® Brick Editor](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/working-with-the-lego-brick-editor-in-fortnite)**.

### Challenge #1: The Duck

In the first challenge you are asked to build a duck. Why a duck? Fun fact: the duck has a very special meaning to the history of LEGO, because the company founder used to make wooden toys, before creating the iconic LEGO bricks. So what better place to start?

This building exercise is designed to get you oriented with the tools, so you can get some experience moving the bricks around and snapping them together.

All the bricks are laid out for you to build with. Feel free to change the brick colors - not all ducks are yellow - and assemble your own unique water fowl!

### Challenge #2: Hearts

In the second challenge, you are asked to build a heart by selecting and dragging the bricks you think you might need from the LEGO® Brick Editor window. You can use any color, or assortment of colors you’d like!

There is no right or wrong in this challenge. Try rotating bricks, snapping different bricks together, and experiment with bricks of different sizes.

### Challenge #3: Modular Fence

The third challenge teaches you how to use the Kragle tool optimally to make reusable assets.

At this teaching pod, you will:

1.    Separate the fence build into bricks.

1.       Identify the repeating pattern in the fence build and select it.

2.       Kragle the fence module and rebuild the fence with duplicates of it.

This is an important step that optimizes the performance of your island, which means you can add in even more bricks!

### Challenge #4: Building Modules

In the fourth challenge, you can start imagining your designs in a modular way. This is similar to the  building actor system in UEFN. Build your own reusable modules out of LEGO bricks, then kragle them and fit them together to build the structure of your LEGO dreams.

Feel free to experiment! You can modify the existing modules or create your own - duplicating an existing segment and separating it back into individual bricks is a quick and efficient way to get started!

## The Playground

The playground is where you can test your creativity by building freely. Here, you’re provided with inspiration such as miniature models and brick sketches. In this section, you are challenged to incorporate your builds into the general UEFN workflow using devices, sequences, or even Verse scripts.

[![If you can build it, you can use it The Playground is where you can play around with miniature building, sketching, and more!](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2511cde5-42ac-4d23-a245-c27c01cbeed0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2511cde5-42ac-4d23-a245-c27c01cbeed0?resizing_type=fit)

## Cinematic Podium

In this last section, we created interactive cinematic for your builds. Place your build in the center of the podium, and see how it becomes part of a flashy party or a scary ghost scene. Just launch the level and press the button!

Next, you’ll decide which one of two pre-made cinematics to use with your build, then sit back and enjoy as your creation takes the spotlight!

## On Your Own

Once you have completed the four challenges, use your new skills to build something that inspires you!

Turn on the LEGO Brick Editor whenever you want to build a custom asset with the available bricks. Below is a list of LEGO documents to help get you started.
