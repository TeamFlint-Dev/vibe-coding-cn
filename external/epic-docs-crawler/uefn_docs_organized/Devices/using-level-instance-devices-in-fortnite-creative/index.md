The **Level Instance** device is a [volume](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#volume) where you can place structures and props, then save the collection. If you need multiple groups of items that are all the same, you can copy and paste the device to place that grouping wherever you need it.

If you edit a copy of the Level Instance device (such as adding or removing props), the change is made to the original and all other copies.

For help finding the **Level Instance** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be helpful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#rename-a-device) them. You can choose names that relate to each device’s purpose, so it’s easier to remember what each one does.

## Contextual Filtering

Some devices are affected by a feature called **contextual filtering**. This feature hides or displays options depending on the values selected for certain related options. This feature reduces clutter in the Customize panel and makes options easier to manage and navigate. However, it may not be easy to recognize which options or values trigger contextual filtering. To help you identify them, in our device docs we use *italic* for any values that trigger contextual filtering. All options will be listed, including those affected by contextual filtering; if they are hidden or displayed based on a specific option’s value, there will be a note about that in the Description field for that option.

## Device Options

This device has some basic functionality, like determining the size of the volume, and whether you can edit the items placed in the device.

You can configure this device with the following options.

Default values are **bold**. Values that trigger contextual filtering are *italic*.

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Edit State** | **Editable**, *Locked* | Determines whether items can be added to this level instance. If you choose **Locked**, the size options do not display. |
| **Level Width** | **5**, Pick a width | Determines the width of the volume, in tiles. Click the arrows to select a number, or click inside the field to type in a number. This option does not display if the **Edit State** option is set to **Locked**. |
| **Level Depth** | **5**, Pick a depth | Determines the depth of the volume, in tiles. Click the arrows to select a number, or click inside the field to type in a number. This option does not display if the **Edit State** option is set to **Locked**. |
| **Level Height** | **5**, Pick a height | Determines the height of the volume, in tiles. Click the arrows to select a number, or click inside the field to type in a number. This option does not display if the **Edit State** option is set to **Locked**. |
| **Level Instance Name** | **Auto-generated name**, pick a name | When you place the Level Instance device, a Level Instance Name is automatically generated by default. To customize the name, click the arrow to open the flyout panel. Click inside the box at the top to edit the name. Click the checkmark to save the name. This is also where you pick from a list of Level Instances you have already created, or click **New Level** to create a new one.

| **Enable at Game Start** | **On**, Off | Determines whether the Level Instance device is enabled when the game starts. If you choose **Off**, the device can only be enabled by a signal from a channel. |
| **Content Collection** | **Creative**, The Block 2.0 | This determines what kind of props, terrain or structures you can place inside the Level Instance volume. The default **Creative** gives you access to all assets in the Creative inventory. Choosing **The Block 2.0** limits you to assets from Battle Royale that can be used in The Block 2.0. |
