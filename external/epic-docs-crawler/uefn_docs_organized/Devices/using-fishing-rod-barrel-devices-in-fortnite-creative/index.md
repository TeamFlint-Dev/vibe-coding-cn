The **Fishing Rod Barrel** device lets players [equip](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) Creative Fishing Rods. Use the Fishing Rod Barrel with the [Fishing Zone](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-fishing-zone-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device so players can fish on your island.

Unlike most other devices, the Fishing Rod Barrel is not customizable—it has no [options](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Press **E** during gameplay to **Search** the barrel and access a fishing rod.

At this time, the barrel device does not distribute Harpoon Guns, and rarely distributes Creative Pro Fishing Rods.

To guarantee players either of these items, use an [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [Item Granter](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device in combination with a barrel or similar-looking [prop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

To find the Accolades device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

## Removing the Device

There are three ways you can remove this device.

- You can remove this device by aiming at the device with your phone and pressing **X**. Doing this removes both the device and the foundation it's attached to.
- You can remove it by destroying the foundation piece it is attached to.
- You can also destroy it by pressing **F** and then attacking the device with your pickaxe. The pickaxe will not destroy the device if **Pickaxe Destruction** is set to **None** in [My Island > Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

It's helpful to [customize device names](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) when you use multiple copies of the same device.
