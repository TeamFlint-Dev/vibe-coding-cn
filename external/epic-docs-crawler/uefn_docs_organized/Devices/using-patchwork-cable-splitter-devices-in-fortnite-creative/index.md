Patchwork devices are set up to handle multiple input cables, but they only have one [output](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) cable. If you want to send the same audio data to multiple devices, you can use the **Patchwork Cable Splitter** to turn one cable input into multiple outputs.

Here are some examples of how you could use this device:

- You can send audio output from one or more Patchwork devices to multiple [Patchwork Speakers](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-patchwork-speaker-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to create [ambient sound](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
- You can apply [distortion](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or another [modulating effect](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to multiple devices so they all change in unison.
- You can organize your Patchwork setup more efficiently by using cable splitters for [cable routing and management](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

For help on how to find the **Patchwork Cable Splitter** device, see [Using Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-devices-in-fortnite).

If you're using multiple copies of a device on an island, it can be useful to [rename](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) them. Choosing names that relate to a device's purpose makes it easier to remember what each one does, and easier to find a specific device when using the [Event Browser](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/event-browser-in-fortnite-creative).
