The **Analytics Dashboard** displays the [event](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#event) data gathered by the [Analytics device](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-analytics-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

The data on this dashboard is useful for analyzing [gameplay](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#gameplay) to find areas that players might find too difficult, where on the island players drop off due to uninteresting gameplay, or other factors. This gives you the chance to re-engage players with new obstacles.

To view your Analytics Dashboard, sign into the [Creator Portal](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#creator-portal) and click the Analytics icon from the [navbar](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#navbar). Your analytics dashboard opens automatically.

## How It Works

Analytics are gathered by the Analytics device daily and sent to the Analytics Dashboard in the [Creator Portal](https://fn.gg/island-creator). The Analytics device is able to retrieve this data based on [Island Code](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#island-code).

| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **1 Analytics Device Dropdown Menu** | Select the island that you want to review from this dropdown menu. |
| **2 Show Me Dropdown Menu** | Select a date range for the data in the list and graph. |
| **3 Download Button** | Download a copy of the data for your records and import the raw data into their spreadsheet app of choice and create their own visualizations. |
| **4 Total Activations Graph** | Shows the data for all devices collectively. |
| **5 Device List** | The full list of registered devices for this island. |

The dashboard displays the analytics for each device registered on an island, one island at a time. To see the analytics for a specific island, search for the island name in the **Analytics Device** dropdown menu.

## Best Practices

Following are recommended guidelines to help you get the most out of the information available for your islands.

- Give each analytic event a unique name so you can tell what the device is monitoring. Add a number if the device is in a sequence of events.
- Use the data from the Analytics device along with the Insights data to understand why some events on your islands perform better than others by looking at the player behavior on your island.
- Islands with low engagement might have a point where the majority of players give up and leave. Use this to focus your updating efforts.
- If your island shows a player drop-off point, playtest your island to troubleshoot why players are leaving at that point, and work out what a modification that will keep players engaged to the next objective.
- Use your social media presence to ask your supporters what they like or dislike about your island experience.
