Use the **Sword in the Stone** device to [place](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#place) the [Infinity Blade](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#infinity-blade) on your island. When placed, the sword becomes available to any player regardless of team affiliation.

A player can use the Infinity Blade to destroy enemies, animals, spawned creatures, and structures around them in a single blow. With this weapon, the player becomes almost indestructible.

The device can be placed on floor pieces or on the ground. To make placement easier:

1. Press the **B** key listed in the [Create mode hotkeys](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode-hotkeys) list to open the [Quick Menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#quick-menu).
2. Make sure [Phase](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#phase) is set to **Off**.
3. Set the **Drops** option to **On**. This makes sure the object you place lands on the ground instead of in the air.
4. Set **Grid Snap** to **1** to snap it into a grid.

With these settings, the device will be much easier to position.

This device is great for a King of the Hill-style [game type](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-type) where there can only be one winner in the end.

This device cannot be customized.

## Designer Tips

In [Play mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-mode), a player can claim the sword by pressing and holding **E** until the sword is released from the stone.

When using the Infinity Blade on vehicles, the sword deals 75 [damage](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#damage) until the last blow, where it deals 50 before blowing up both the car and the player holding the sword.

Players who use the Infinity Blade cannot hold other weapons while using this one.
