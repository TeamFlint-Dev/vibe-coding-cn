You can copy your preferred chest by activating your [phone](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) tool and left-clicking to drag a duplicate. Duplicated chests do not offer identical items. Every chest offers a random selection of items with different quantities.
