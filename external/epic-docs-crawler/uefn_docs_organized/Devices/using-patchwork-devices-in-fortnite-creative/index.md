Patchwork is a suite of devices for Fortnite Creative and UEFN that allow you to create and manipulate music and visuals.

You can directly control these devices, or set them up to sync with gameplay states and events.

## Finding Patchwork Devices

From the Devices tab in the Creative inventory, you can find the Patchwork devices in several ways. You can search for them directly by using the term Patchwork, or browse for the devices under Audio.

Patchwork devices are also grouped into a Device Gallery and three Device prefabs. The Device Gallery contains all the Patchwork devices unconnected. The three prefabs have devices already connected: Drums, Bass, and Melody. If you search or select the Patchwork tab, all individual devices, the gallery, and the prefabs will show.
