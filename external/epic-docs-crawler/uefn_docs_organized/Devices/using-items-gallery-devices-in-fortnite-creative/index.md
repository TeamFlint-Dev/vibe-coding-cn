You can use the **Items Gallery** to offer players a quick status buff during gameplay. These status buffs will temporarily give the consuming player an increase of either health, shield, speed boost, or jump boost.

Selecting the Items Gallery will place eight different items that you can choose from. The preferred item can be copied by equipping the cell phone device and left-clicking to drag a duplicate as explained in **[Moving and Removing the Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-items-gallery-devices-in-fortnite-creative)**.

Players can consume the item by standing near it and pressing **E**. Players will not be able to equip these items in their inventories.

Players can also stack items that offer status buffs, such as the **Hop Rock** and **Pepper**.
