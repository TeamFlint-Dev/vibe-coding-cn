## Drum Beat Samples

Drum beat samples are selected from the Sample Library, and can be changed and modified when you specify the Sample Shape, Sample Tune, and Sample Volume. Adjusting different knobs can modify the drum sound so much it makes a totally new sound!

The drum beat samples represent different parts of a drum set, such as the bass or kick drum, the snare drum, and so on. When you have a drum kit selected in the Kit Carousel, and the Preset Link button is on, the selected drum beat sample will be set to the Kit's default sound for the Drum Note icon. By turning off the Preset Link for one or more of the columns, you could choose a kick drum from one drum set, a snare from a second drum set, and so on.

The controls above each selected drum beat sample allow you to adjust its [Shape](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), Tune, and Volume.
