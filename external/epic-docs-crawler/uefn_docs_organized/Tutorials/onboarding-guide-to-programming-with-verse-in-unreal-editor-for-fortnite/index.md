For a smooth start in using **Verse** to create gameplay in **Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN)**, follow these steps in order, skipping any steps you're already familiar with.

For anyone who is new to programming, or who wants a refresher, these onboarding steps will help to make sure you get the knowledge you'll need, along with recommended best practices for writing code in Verse.

## Step 1: Thinking Like a Programmer

Here's a short video to introduce you to how programmers think!

## Step 2: Getting Acquainted with the Tools

Before you jump into any other docs, go through the steps in [Modify and Run Your First Verse Program](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/modify-and-run-your-first-verse-program-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite). This guide shows you how to create a new UEFN project that uses Verse, how to find your Verse code in UEFN, and how to run and edit a simple Verse program (Hello, World).

## Step 3: Learning to Write Code

If you're new to programming, or want a refresher, go through [Learn the Basics of Writing Code in Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/learn-the-basics-of-writing-code-in-verse) to become familiar with writing code.

Learn the Basics of Writing Code in Verse

A short course to introduce Verse to people with no programming experience whatsoever. No. Programming. Experience. Whatsoever. Seriously.](<https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/learn-the-basics-of-writing-code-in-verse>)

## Step 4: Learning to Use Verse in UEFN

Now that you're acquainted with the tools and a little familiar with writing code, you're ready to learn how you can use Verse to create your own device and in UEFN.

Build a Game

Follow these hands-on tutorials to learn how to combine and modify assets and create different games and experiences!](<https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/build-a-game-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite>)

Or, use the template projects as a starting point.

## Step 6: On Your Own

You've now written code and programmed your own games in Verse and UEFN!

Modify the games you created from the templates and tutorials, or recreate your favorite games and levels using Verse and UEFN.

While you program your games, the following materials are available for reference:

- A [UEFN Glossary](unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary) for definitions related to UEFN and a [Verse Glossary](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary) for general programming definitions and Verse-specific terms.
- [Verse Language Reference](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-language-reference) for learning more about the Verse programming language features and how to use them.
- [Verse API Reference](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-api) for exploring the API to access functionality and objects provided by UEFN as well as common programming functionality.
