You can use the **Cannon Spawner** device to add a unique weapon to your island — because it’s also a vehicle, and a way to launch yourself into the air! In this design example, you will learn how to create a unique team game mode themed around two castles at war. Your players will use the cannons to conquer their enemy's castle!

## Devices Used

- 16 x [Player Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices
- 18 x [Cannon Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-cannon-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices
- 16 x [Objective](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-objective-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices

You will buiild the castles, add the devices, then set up the game rules with the Island Settings.

## Construct the Play Area

1. Create a single castle on your island.

2. Once the walls are laid out, copy the base of the castle to where you want the second castle. In this example, the castle bases are close enough that players can use the Cannon Spawners to launch themselves over the walls of the enemy castle, or shoot at the enemy doors.

3. Add a central section to each castle where you will place the Objective devices.

4. Add small blocks around the edges of your castle walls for players to use as cover.

## Add Objective Devices

Objective devices will be used in two ways on this island. First, you will set up some to act as destructible gates to your castles, then you'll add Objective devices to serve as scoring goals.

Be sure to set the correct team for each device!

1. Place the first **Objective** device into an open hole in one of the castle walls to act as a gate.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c8b128a8-51fe-4afb-9464-f003e0692a2b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c8b128a8-51fe-4afb-9464-f003e0692a2b?resizing_type=fit)
2. Use these settings to customize the gate.

3. Copy and paste three more Objective devices in the remaining wall holes.

4. Place four additional Objective devices as the main scoring goal for each castle.

5. Customize them with the settings below:

Again, remember to set the team settings correctly for each castle!

## Add Remaining Devices

1. Add some Cannon Spawner devices to the castles, and to the tops of the two towers in the middle of the map.

   Note that in the example below, the color of the primitive pieces was changed to match the team colors for each side.

2. Add Player Spawner devices on the walls of both castles.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2c4674ab-8e8c-4416-a64b-2009e5033199?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2c4674ab-8e8c-4416-a64b-2009e5033199?resizing_type=fit)

## Configure the Island Settings

1. Make sure that some of the advanced movement modes are turned on for the **Player** settings:

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/87ac1f95-72c1-4f06-b8f7-875945301507?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/87ac1f95-72c1-4f06-b8f7-875945301507?resizing_type=fit)

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/365f3c8d-9f26-4a01-b1ab-fa6995b01878?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/365f3c8d-9f26-4a01-b1ab-fa6995b01878?resizing_type=fit)
2. Configure the **Game Mode** settings:

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/47052985-3dcb-4919-aa0f-a617cc396c4c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/47052985-3dcb-4919-aa0f-a617cc396c4c?resizing_type=fit)
3. Configure the **Round** settings:

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7d3eefb1-5f63-41c8-af19-aa04e61c5ace?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7d3eefb1-5f63-41c8-af19-aa04e61c5ace?resizing_type=fit)

And there you have it — a unique game mode built around the features of the Cannon Spawner device!

## Design Tip

For more variety, add other weapons and vehicles to your island.
