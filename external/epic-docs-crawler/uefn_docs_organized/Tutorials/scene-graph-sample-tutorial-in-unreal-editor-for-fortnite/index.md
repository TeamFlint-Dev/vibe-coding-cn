The Scene Graph Sample Tutorial is designed to showcase the different ways Scene Graph can be harnessed for total world building. The project is set up to walk you through asset iteration and gameplay iteration. As you move through the tutorial hall there are a series of booths set up to show how the iteration process works in Scene Graph.

You’ll learn about working with Scene Graph to design functional assets, and create game mechanics in Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). Scene Graph elements are packaged in the Content Browser, where you can open the complimentary folders in individual browser tabs to easily search for prefabs and supplementary materials.
