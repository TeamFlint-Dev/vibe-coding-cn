When a Rocket Racing vehicle passes over an **RR EMP Volume** device, the vehicle is slowed down.

This device is only available to use in a Rocket Racing UEFN island template and will only work when creating Rocket Racing experiences.

The amount of speed the player loses and the duration of the speed loss are not editable, which ensures consistency for both gameplay and player expectations within Rocket Racing. However, you can change the shape of the device.
