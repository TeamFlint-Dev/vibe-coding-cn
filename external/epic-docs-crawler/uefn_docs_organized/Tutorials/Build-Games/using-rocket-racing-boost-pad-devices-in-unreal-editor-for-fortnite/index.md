When a Rocket Racing vehicle drives over a **RR Boost Pad** device, it gets a speed boost.

This device is only available to use in the Rocket Racing UEFN Island Template and will only work when creating Rocket Racing experiences.

The amount of speed the player gains and the duration of the speed boost is not editable, which ensures gameplay consistency and player expectations within Rocket Racing.
