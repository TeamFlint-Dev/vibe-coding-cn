**Rocket Racing (RR)** has a specialized set of devices that are only found on the Rocket Racing islands. You can use these devices to create your own Rocket Racing tracks and experiences.

At this time, Rocket Racing devices do not have [Verse](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/programming-with-verse-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) [APIs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-glossary#api).

## Device Setup Requirements

When you launch a session in UEFN, your Rocket Racking island will go through validation to make sure your island is set up for a Rocket Racing experience. Any check that fails will report an error message in the Output Log.

All Rocket Racing-specific devices have specific checks and error messages, so refer to the documentation for each device for details on how to avoid these errors.

## Finding Rocket Racing Devices

You can find the Rocket Racing devices in a couple of ways.

You can search in the **Content Browser** directly using **Rocket Racing**, or find all the Rocket Racing devices listed in the **Devices** folder.

You can also find them with the **Devices** category in the **Creative inventory** by searching for Rocket Racing or browsing the **Rocket Racing** subcategory.

The Rocket Racing devices only show up in Creative inventory if you access it from UEFN. Since these devices can't be used in Fortnite Creative, they won't show from there.
