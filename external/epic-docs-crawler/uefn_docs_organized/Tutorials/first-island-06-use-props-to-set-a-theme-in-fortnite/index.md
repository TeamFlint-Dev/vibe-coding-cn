The final step in this tutorial is how to make your game look like a shooting gallery. To do this, you'll be using props and gallery assets from Creative.

A **theme** is the basic concept of a game, especially in terms of how it looks. For example, the theme of this game is a shooting gallery like you might find at a carnival, so you'll want to use elements that match that theme.

A **prop** is an object you can place on your island. A prop can be furniture, walls or floors for constructing buildings, plants, or any of hundreds of other things. Props usually fit with one or more themes.

Props can be found in **prefabs** (prefabricated structures) and **galleries**, which are collections of similarly themed props. To build the theming for this game, the following galleries, props, and sound cues were used.

- **Mega Mall gallery**
- 6 x **Princess Castle Toy Bunny** prop
- 1 x **Commerce Shelve Toy 02** prop
- 1 x **Carnival Game Deactivation Laugh 01** Cue

If you add props in Fortnite Creative, you'll have your player avatar as reference for size when scaling the props.

To do this, you can use the hotkeys covered in [Hotkeys and Keybinding Shortcuts](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/hotkey-and-keybinding-shortcuts-in-fortnite-creative).

Changes you make in Creative during a live edit session will be saved in UEFN.

## Set the Theme in Creative

1. From the **Edit Session** in **Creative**, press the **M** key to open the **Creative Menu**, then select **Galleries**.
2. In the search box, type **mega mall**, then double-click the first thumbnail to expand the contents of this gallery.

   Type mega mall into the search bar.
3. Find a floor that fits your theme and double-click to add it to the **[quick bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#quickbar)** at the bottom.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d2d314d8-0c0f-48af-ae4f-2540dbb1b71c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d2d314d8-0c0f-48af-ae4f-2540dbb1b71c?resizing_type=fit)

   The mega mall gallery of props.
4. Click **Equip** to add any other assets you want to use to the quick bar, then click **Exit** to go back to the island.
5. Select the **striped wall**, then place it on the grid and right-click to place it.

   Continue placing walls until you’ve surrounded the targets.
6. Select the **tile floor**, then left-click to place it in the corner of the target room.

   Continue placing floor pieces until you have a 4 x 4 square.
7. Add a **short wall** to stop players from entering the shooting gallery.
8. Create the area behind the player and add a roof to finish the level design.

   Complete set dressing for the shooting gallery.

Next you’re ready to add set dressing to make the project feel more polished. You’ll move back into UEFN to add set dressing, lighting, and some audio effects to finish your first island.

## Dress the Set in UEFN

**Set dressing** is when you add assets and other details to create a visually appealing environment that supports the game design and game genre.

UEFN has an abundance of assets that fit your theme.

### Add Props

Ready to add some props? You can look for toys, toy shelves, posters and anything else that gives your project that carnival vibe.

1. From the **Windows** menu, open two more **Content Browsers**.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b2a87086-0298-4a08-b61a-086a4d3aa90b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b2a87086-0298-4a08-b61a-086a4d3aa90b?resizing_type=fit)

   Add another Content Browser.
2. In the second Content Browser window, open the **Fortnite**> **Props**folders and type **Toys**in the search bar. This surfaces toy props in the Asset View.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f607780a-53e4-40a3-b019-bb57044911cf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f607780a-53e4-40a3-b019-bb57044911cf?resizing_type=fit)

   Search for Toys.
3. Drag the **Commerce Shelve Toys 2** into the viewport and arrange them in the scene where you think they look best.
4. Next, type **Princess Toy** into the search bar and drag the **Princess Castle Toy Bunny** onto the walls in the viewport to give the idea that prizes could be won at this game.

   Search for toys.

## Add Audio

Adding sounds in video games adds a whole new layer of interest for the player. Your sound design should work well with your visual elements.

A **sound cue** is an audio object that you can use with other audio files to do things like creating **loops** (sounds that repeat) or sounds that **fade** as players move away.

UEFN provides a number of sound cues that you can find in **Sounds** under the **Fortnite** folder. You can listen to a sound cue by hovering over it then pressing the **play** icon.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5f33ca49-fae9-400d-ab55-4c4b22ad45c6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5f33ca49-fae9-400d-ab55-4c4b22ad45c6?resizing_type=fit)

Sound Cue

Sound cues must be used with an Audio device. You'll use the **[Audio Player](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-audio-player-devices-in-fortnite-creative)** device and add the selected sound cue to it.

1. In the **Content Browser**, open the **Fortnite** > **Devices** folders and type **Audio** into the search bar.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5bc01f0d-a36a-45f3-b775-aa5d1985c68d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5bc01f0d-a36a-45f3-b775-aa5d1985c68d?resizing_type=fit)

   Search for Audio devices.
2. Drag the **Audio Player** into the viewport and position it behind the Player Spawn Pad.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1f1ffc26-47de-4e19-8120-051fef21ffff?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1f1ffc26-47de-4e19-8120-051fef21ffff?resizing_type=fit)

   Add an Audio Player.
3. In the **Details** panel, type the sound cue name in the Audio dropdown search bar to surface the sound cue.
4. Select the sound cue from the list.
   This new sound cue is the audio that plays from this device. For the shooting gallery, the **Fairground\_Spot\_11** sound cue was selected.
5. Uncheck
   the **Play on Hit** option. Players will not interact with this device to hear the sound effects.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96e7a422-c44c-4189-adbe-ac5d404408b1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/96e7a422-c44c-4189-adbe-ac5d404408b1?resizing_type=fit)

   Play On HIt
6. Set **Play Location** to **Local Player** so the sound is localized to the player’s location.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5d4753fc-8ffb-4c85-8431-adfc63d463fd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5d4753fc-8ffb-4c85-8431-adfc63d463fd?resizing_type=fit)

   Play Location
7. Set **Stereo Spread** to **2.0 m**, this way the audio plays equally on the left and right of the player avatar within 2 meters of the device.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0a75843f-68b8-4a7c-b46a-e95bcc815f69?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0a75843f-68b8-4a7c-b46a-e95bcc815f69?resizing_type=fit)

   Stereo Spread

### Bind the Audio Device

To make the Audio device play automatically without player interaction, the device needs to be bound to the event of another device.

1. Under **User Options - Functions**, click the **+** icon next to **Play** to open the Array element dropdown menu.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2541318c-908e-40c3-9adb-d797fd2acfaf?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2541318c-908e-40c3-9adb-d797fd2acfaf?resizing_type=fit)

   Add a Device to the Play Option under User Options.
2. Type **Player** in the search bar to surface the Player Spawn Pad.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3cae0455-44b9-4ac0-968c-3e0c4bfc9a3b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3cae0455-44b9-4ac0-968c-3e0c4bfc9a3b?resizing_type=fit)

   Search for Player Spawn Pad.
3. Select **Player Spawn Pad** from the dropdown menu. The Player Spawn Pad events are now available in the event dropdown.
4. Select **On Player Spawned** from the event dropdown menu.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b14ba743-6eb5-4e08-b5a9-f64b4b625e20?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b14ba743-6eb5-4e08-b5a9-f64b4b625e20?resizing_type=fit)

   Select On Player Spawned from the dropdown menu.

When the player spawns onto the island, the sound cue plays right away.
