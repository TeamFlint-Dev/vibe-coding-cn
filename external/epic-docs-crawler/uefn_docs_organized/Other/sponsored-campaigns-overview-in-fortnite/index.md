[Sponsored Row](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#sponsored-row) offers the opportunity to boost your island’s visibility in Discover by bidding for [impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#impression) through an [auction-based system](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#secondprice-auction-model). By creating a paid [campaign](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#campaign), you can bid to have your island appear in the Sponsored Row, a clearly labeled row where players can see promoted islands alongside the usual content surfaced by [Discover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#discover-ui).

A sponsored island may benefit from:

- Increased [impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#impression) of your Island, whether testing early content or supporting a major launch.
- If your Island metadata is engaging, you may see more [clicks](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#clicks) on your island thumbnail from players browsing Discover.
- More active players which helps you grow your community and visibility.

## How to Get Started with Sponsored Row

1. **Accepting the terms.**

   Only an Island Owner can create a campaign. During your first-time Campaign creation, you will need to:

   - Accept the **Sponsored Content Terms**.
   - Acknowledge the Epic’s **Fortnite Developer Rules** Section 5 (Sponsored Row Content Rules).
   - Acknowledge that any IP license is broad enough to grant Epic Games a license consistent with the **[Epic Games Terms of Service](https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/tos)**. Read more in **Fortnite Developer Rules** Section 1.7.

   See **[Campaign FAQs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/campaign-faqs-in-fortnite)** for a list of frequently asked questions and answers.
2. **Start a campaign.**

   From the **Campaigns dashboard** in Creator Portal you can select **Create campaign** to begin setting up a campaign.
3. **Build your campaign.**

   When you build your campaign, you select from an active island that has already been published and passed moderation. Next, you select your campaign duration, which will need to begin two days from the current date. Then, you’ll determine your daily budget and a maximum bid.

   See **[Creating and Editing a Campaign](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-and-editing-campaigns-in-fortnite)** for a full walkthrough on creating your first campaign and the campaign data available while your campaign runs.
4. **Select your payment method.**

   You only pay for the impressions for your campaign on a daily basis. Select a supported payment method to authorize your payment. For details on payments, see **[Campaign Payments](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/campaign-payments-in-fortnite)**.
5. **Submit your campaign.**

   Before an island can appear in Sponsored Row, it must pass an additional moderation review. In addition to following the **Fortnite Developer Rules**, **[Epic Games Content Guidelines](https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/content-guidelines)**, and **[Community Rules](https://legal.epicgames.com/en-US/epicgames/community-rules)**, the Island must also meet the **Sponsored Row Content Rules** (outlined in Section 5 of the Fortnite Developer Rules).

   Campaigns must be submitted at least **two calendar days** before your desired start date to allow for content review.

## How the Auction Works

To appear in the Sponsored Row, your campaign must first be submitted and approved. Once approved and your campaign start date has been reached, your bid enters the auction.

What you set in your Campaign:

- **Campaign duration**: How long your campaign will run.
- **Daily budget**: The maximum you're willing to spend each day.
- **Max bid price**: How much you’re willing to pay per 1,000 impressions ([CPM = Cost Per Mille](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#cpm)).

You can adjust these values to estimate the number of daily impressions your bid might earn. When you're satisfied, click **Submit Campaign** to enter the queue.

To introduce a balanced variety of island content, Epic may limit the number of islands belonging to the same genre from surfacing in Sponsored Row at the same time.

### Finalizing Your Bid

You can edit your bid up until 23:59 coordinated universal time (UTC) on the day before your campaign is scheduled to begin. After that, it becomes locked in for the auction.

The auction begins every day at **00:00 UTC**, and all eligible campaigns that have passed moderation for ad rules will participate in a live auction. Your campaign competes against all other campaigns each day based on the maximum bid you’ve set. As long as your campaign is live, it continues to participate in the auction.

**Going live**: Campaigns with the first winning bids will go live in the Sponsored Row at **00:00 UTC daily**.

**Example**: If you want your island to have an opportunity to appear in the Sponsored Row on November 24, submit your campaign by November 22 at 23:59 UTC and finalize your bids by November 23 at 23:59 UTC.

Higher bids are prioritized and appear in the sponsored row earlier in the day.

Once a bid has won the auction, the Impressions are delivered in **daily bursts**.

Once an island enters the Sponsored Row, it remains there until its full **max daily budget** is delivered or the end of the day is reached.

For more information about bidding and auctions, see **[Campaign Bidding and Auction Mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/campaign-bidding-and-auction-mechanics-in-fortnite)**. **Please note we make no guarantees regarding the performance or results of any campaign.**

## Player Experience in Discover

Sponsored Row will appear prominently in Discover on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, Android, iOS, and iPadOS. It will not appear on Nintendo Switch platforms, cloud-streaming services, or [Fortnite.com](http://fortnite.com). Players under the age of 18 will not see the Sponsored Row. All other rows in Discover remain unchanged, continuing to provide organic visibility for islands.
