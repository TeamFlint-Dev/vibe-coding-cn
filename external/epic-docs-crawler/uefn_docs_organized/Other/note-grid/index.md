An area in a Patchwork [note-generating](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#notegenerator) device where you can select notes. Laid out in a grid pattern, the rows represent pitches (notes) and the columns represent [steps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#step) in time, with the [step rate](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#steprate) control on the device defining how fast it moves through those steps.
