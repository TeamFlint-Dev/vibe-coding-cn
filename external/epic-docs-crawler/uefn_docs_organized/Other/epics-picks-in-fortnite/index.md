## Three Pillars of Epic's Picks: Innovation, Gameplay, and Environment

### Innovation

Find something new to do in Fortnite that hasn’t been tried before or introduce a whole new way of playing a common mode. Experimentation and iteration is the key.

- **Uniqueness** - Find genres or game modes that inspire you and that have rarely been seen in Fortnite. Just because an idea has been tried before doesn’t mean you can’t improve on it or make it completely different.
- **Technical execution** - Using current tools and [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device), show off how much you know about UEFN. Find creative ways to execute your ideas. You can inspire the next wave of content by figuring out creative solutions.
- **It's all about fun** -  The game needs to be engaging and exciting! Ideas are great when the audience can resonate and have fun playing together or solo. What makes this game a must try? Why should players find your game compelling? Answering fundamental questions like these build the basis of all great games!

### Gameplay

Create something new or make improvements to existing genres that weren’t thought of before.

- **Mechanics** - Introduce a new feature or [mechanic](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics) that fits the theme or genre of the island. Find ways to make the gameplay more interesting than what has been previously tried.  The game should feel new and easy enough for players to pick up on.
- **Design** -  The experience should feel fresh and intuitive. The more complicated it is, the more effort needs to be put into introducing it in a simple, streamlined way. Balance the difficulty level with friendly systems that welcome new players and reward returning players.
- **Replayability** - Unlock multiple ways for players to interact and experience your game. Whether that's through exploration, finding hidden secrets, being the best, or developing multiple ways for players to interact with your content, give players a reason to keep coming back.

### Environment

Create an island that is memorable and unique. Something that sticks out from the very first moment. These elements set your environment apart:

- **Lighting and atmosphere** - The placement and intensity of lighting can set the mood of your island. It can also help players navigate around the map and find key points of interest.
- **Visual distinctiveness** - Using unique assets or models that give your island a distinctive style makes it stand out from the rest.
- **Map Layout and Flow** -  How players move through the island and the pacing are core concepts that make an island fun to play. Alternating between open and closed spaces, providing line of sight to objectives, or unlocking new areas are subtle ways to let players know where to go. Good navigation and flow means players can maintain engagement with your island while feeling confident they know how to navigate it.
- **Environment details** - Layering your map to include elevation of underground spaces keeps it from being stale. Give players unique ways to navigate your space, and be thoughtful about the details you add, like props and terrain.
