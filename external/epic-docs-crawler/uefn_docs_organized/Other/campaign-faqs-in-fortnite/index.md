[Sponsored Row](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#sponsored-row) is a clearly labeled row for promoted islands included with the usual content generated by Discover. A Sponsored Row [Campaign](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#campaign) is a tool in Fortnite to help you increase visibility for your islands.

When you submit a campaign for publishing from the Creator Portal, your campaign goes through a review process to determine whether your island complies with the [**Fortnite Developer Rules**](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) and the [**Epic Games Content Guidelines**](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/content-guidelines).

Below are curated lists of the most frequently asked questions, sorted into categories.

## Getting Started and Eligibility

### What is the Sponsored Row?

Sponsored Row is a special row in Discover where creators bid for [impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#impression) to boost their island’s visibility. Island placements refresh on each page load and are labeled as **Sponsored**.

### Who can run Sponsored Row campaigns?

Island owners who are enrolled in the Island Creator Program and who are 18 years old or older.

### Which islands are eligible?

1. Islands must be published, listed, and in good standing to be eligible.
2. You can run only one live campaign per island at a time, but you're free to run campaigns across multiple islands.
3. You can also create multiple campaigns per island, as long as only one is active at any given time.

### Who sees the Sponsored Row?

Logged-in players who are **18+** and are on supported platforms (PC, iOS, iPadOS, Android, Xbox, and PlayStation.

## Access and Accounts

### Where do I access the Sponsored Row tools?

These tools are available in the Creator Portal, on the main menu, under **Campaigns**. Clicking Campaigns opens the beginning setup for a campaign. Once you have set up a campaign, return to the Campaigns page to monitor your live campaigns.

### Why would the Campaigns tab be disabled for me?

You may not be able to see Campaigns listed in the main menu if you are not enrolled in, or not in good standing with, the Island Creator Program.

## Creation and Publishing

### How do I create a campaign?

From the Campaigns page in Creator Portal, select a published island from the **Island** dropdown menu of the campaign form, then choose a duration of time for your campaign. Next, you’ll set a daily budget and add a max bid price, then add a valid payment method. Last, you’ll submit your campaign.

For more detailed steps, see **[Creating and Editing a Campaign](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-and-editing-campaigns-in-fortnite)**.

### What are the bid and budget limits?

Bid and budget limits are the minimum and maximum amount of money you are allowed to enter into the bid and budget fields. The bid and budget limits are as follows:

- **Max bid price**: $0.10–$20
- **Max Daily budget**: $5–$25,000
- **Campaign duration**: 1–30 days

### Can I run multiple campaigns at once?

Yes, you can run multiple campaigns at once across the islands you own. However, you can only run **one campaign per day per island**.

### Can I edit, pause, or cancel a campaign?

Yes, within the allowed windows, you can briefly pause (7 days) or entirely cancel a campaign.  Before a campaign is activated, you can edit all of the elements of your campaign.  Once a campaign has started, you can edit the end date and the Campaign Name. After the campaign is completed, you can still edit the campaign name.

### Are Sponsored Campaigns moderated?

Yes. The island associated with the Sponsored Campaigns undergoes additional moderation for Fortnite Developer Rules Section 5 compliance, even if it was already approved for Discover.

### Why was my Island approved for Discover but not for the Sponsored Row?

The Sponsored Row is subject to additional review standards under Fortnite Developer Rules Section 5. An island may meet the requirements to appear in Discover but still be ineligible for paid promotion if it does not comply with the Section 5 guidelines.

### Can a player report my island when it is in the Sponsored Row?

Yes. Players can use the existing Fortnite reporting tools.

## Campaign Payments

### Do I pay if my campaign didn’t get all the impressions I planned?

You only pay for the [impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#impression) that were actually delivered and during your campaign daily and at the price of your winning bid.

### Can I split payments or prepay?

No. Your payment method is charged automatically at the end of each day your campaign runs for the [impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#impression) delivered that day.

### Which currency will I be charged in?

You are usually charged in your local currency, where supported. Otherwise, you are charged in United States dollars (USD). Taxes are added where required by your region.

### Where do I find my receipts?

All campaign receipts are emailed to the island owner.

### What happens to an active campaign if there is a payment issue?

If there is a payment issue, all active campaigns are paused. You cannot create a new campaign until payment is resolved.  Once the payment issue is resolved, all active campaigns will resume their effective status on the next day UTC.

### What happens to my campaigns if my payments become overdue?

After the seven-day grace period from the payment issue not being resolved, all campaigns will be canceled, and the associated island’s Engagement Payout (EP) reward will be deducted to cover the outstanding balance.  Additionally, campaign creation is not permitted until all overdue payments have been paid.

### Does Epic keep revenue from Sponsored Row?

Long-term, 50% of sponsorship revenue generated by Sponsored Row will go into the engagement payout pool, boosting the pool size for all creators. From launch through the end of 2026, this rate will be 100%.

## Campaign Dashboard

### How often does the data in the campaign update?

Data is typically refreshed hourly.

### How often does the data on the Market History Chart update?

Data is typically refreshed daily and will reflect historical metrics starting from the previous day UTC.

### Will all of the campaign analytics transfer over if I transfer an island to a new owner?

No, all campaign information stays with the campaign owner because they paid for the campaign.

### Can I transfer an island to a team if I have unpaid campaigns?

Creators cannot transfer an island with active or unpaid campaigns.

### If an island is transferred, who retains past campaign data?

Past campaign data remains with the island owner who created the campaign.

## Features and Limits

### How many sponsored tiles appear?

One Sponsored Row section shows per eligible player. Tile count may vary in the Sponsored Row, but it is expected that at least 6 and up to 12 sponsored island tiles show at a time.

### How does the auction work?

Sponsored Row uses a [second-price auction](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#secondprice-auction-model). That means that the highest bid wins but pays the next highest bid price plus a small increment.

### Do I pay my full bid in a second-price auction?

No, in a second‑price [auction](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#auction) the winner pays just above the next highest bid. If the next highest bidder has the same bid price or $0.01 less than your bid, you will pay the price you bid.

### Why would I cluster the impressions of my island?

Concentrating your campaign delivery in a burst or cluster of [impressions](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#impression) improves the odds of players going to play your game and generating [concurrent player counts (CCUs)](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#concurrent-users).

### Will a player see the same sponsored island every time?

No. Islands rotate frequently to ensure diversity based on the campaign bids, budgets, and pacing. A creator's island can only appear once per page load even if they’ve paid for multiple campaigns.

## Review / Moderation / Policy

### Why was my island okay in Discover but rejected for Sponsored Row?

Sponsored campaigns follow stricter [advertising policies](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules) than Discover. To learn more about sponsored campaigns, see **[Sponsored Row Campaigns Overview](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/sponsored-campaigns-overview-in-fortnite)**.

### What happens if I break the Sponsored Row rules in the middle of a campaign?

Should you be found by our team to have broken one of the rules during a live campaign, your campaign will be canceled. Your island could also be removed or demonetized, depending on the severity.

### Can sponsored row campaigns link outside of Fortnite?

No.
All tiles will link to the associated islands Island Detail page.

### What if my island has a low click-through-rate (CRT) in Discover or low island performance?

Low-performing campaigns may be removed to protect both player experience and the creators' budget. If your island has low [CTR](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#ctr) or island performance metrics, your island might be removed from the Sponsored Row.

If this happens, you will need to update and re-publish your island before you  create a new campaign for any island that has been removed from Sponsored Row due to low performance.

Use the island metrics available from your Project menu under [Analytics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/project-analytics-for-fortnite-games) to improve your creative and in‑island experience before republishing your island. Below is a list of documents to help you create supplemental materials for your island.

## Troubleshooting and Error Messages

### Why can’t I submit for review?

An island must be published, listed, and in good standing to be eligible for Sponsored Row. You must be the owner, and have a valid payment method. For more information, see **[Sponsored Campaign Overview](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/sponsored-campaigns-overview-in-fortnite)**.

### Why isn’t my island showing in the campaign Project dropdown menu?

The island may be unpublished, flagged for similarity, Island version rejected for Campaign use or Low Performance, or not owned by you.

## Contact and Escalation Paths

If you experience issues with your campaign or need clarification on some aspect of it, your first step should be to review the documentation. If this does not resolve the issue, submit a ticket with the **Creator Code**, **Island Code**, **[Campaign ID](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#campaign-id)**, and screenshots that pertain to the issue.
