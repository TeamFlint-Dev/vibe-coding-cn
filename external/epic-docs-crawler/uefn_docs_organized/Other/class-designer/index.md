A device you can use to define a custom [class](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#class) with unique [attributes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#attribute) and inventory [loadouts](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#loadout). Each device is used for a single custom class, but you can place multiple Class Designer Devices if you need to design more than one custom class. You can assign attributes in the Customize Class designer interface, and add inventory to the class by dropping items on the device to register them to the class. Class Designer is used with [Class Selector](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#classselector).

For more on how to use these, see [Class Designer Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-class-designer-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
