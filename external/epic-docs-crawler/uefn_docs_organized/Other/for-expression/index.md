A `for` [expression](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#expression), sometimes called a **for loop**, is the same as a [loop](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/loop) expression, except that `for` expressions are [constrained](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/constrained), which means that the number of iterations is known before the `for` loop is executed, and decisions on when to exit the loop are automated. For more info, see [For](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/for-expression).
