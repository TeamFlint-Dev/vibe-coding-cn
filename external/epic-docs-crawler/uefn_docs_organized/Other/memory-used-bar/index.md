When you're in [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#createmode) in Creative, there's a MEMORY USED bar at the top of the screen. It shows the amount of memory used compared to memory available. As you add objects to your island, you’ll see the amount of memory used increase, and the amount of available memory go down. This becomes important if you start running low on memory, and can happen if you add too many objects to your island. Also see [Cell Memory Used](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#cellmemoryusedbar) bar.
