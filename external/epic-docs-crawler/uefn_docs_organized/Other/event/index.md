Events are things that trigger functions. Functions are things that devices do when triggered. This is the basis of the mechanics you use to create gameplay.

Compare to [function](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#function).

**In Verse**, an event is an action or occurrence that can be identified. For example, the Button device has the `InteractedWithEvent`, which occurs whenever a player interacts with the button. You can define behavior that results for a specific event by subscribing with an [event handler](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#event-handler).
