A Damage Rail will cause a player to lose health if touched. There are two Damage Rails — a Half Damage Rail and a Full Damage Rail. The only difference between the two is that the Full Damage Rail takes up two grid spaces, while the Half Damage Rail only takes up one. Damage Rails cannot be customized.
