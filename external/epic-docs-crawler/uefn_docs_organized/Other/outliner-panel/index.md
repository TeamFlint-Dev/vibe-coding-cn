The Outliner panel, or Outliner for short, displays all [actors](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-glossary#actor) within a scene in a hierarchical tree view. In the panel, you also have an option to search for an actor element in the level, and to create folders to group actor elements together.
