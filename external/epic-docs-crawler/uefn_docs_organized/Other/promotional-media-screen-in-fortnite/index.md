Promotional Media is any visual media that supports your island, and a key element is your island's [thumbnail](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#thumbnail) image. You must submit a thumbnail for your island as part of the review process. You will not be able to submit your island for review until you attach a thumbnail to your island.

## Landscape Thumbnail

A landscape thumbnail is an image of your island. Select an area of your island that either includes a picture of a game mechanic, or a scenic picture of your set dressing. You can even do **A/B Testing** with two thumbnails to see which thumbnail players engage with more.

Under **Media**, click **Add landscape thumbnail** to add still images. Click **Create A/B test** to submit two landscape thumbnail images. To learn more about how A/B Testing works, see the **[A/B Thumbnail Testing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/ab-thumbnail-testing-in-fortnite-creative)** document.

All thumbnails you submit must meet a set of criteria for publication. There are a few general points to remember when creating any images related to your island. All images should:

- Accurately represent your game
- Be engaging
- Be original
- Follow all of the [brand guidelines for Fortnite](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/game-collections-in-fortnite)
- Follow the **[Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-island-creator-rules)**

All uploaded promotional images go through a series of content pre-checks during the submission process. Thumbnail images for your island are scanned to make sure they’re not misleading and that they’re not too similar to media another creator has already published. If your thumbnail is too similar, or is misleading, you’ll be prompted to provide a new image for your island.

If you choose to submit your island without fixing any media that received a similarity warning, your island may get filtered out of top rows in Discover when it gets published. For information on how **Discover filtering** affects islands in Discover, see **[How Discover Works](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/how-discover-works-in-fortnite)**.

For more on creating thumbnails that adhere to the thumbnail guidelines, see the Thumbnail Image Guidelines for Discover document.

### A/B Thumbnail Testing

Part of the publishing and development process involves A/B thumbnail testing. This provides a way to compare thumbnail response and see performative results for thumbnails based on engagement. Increased engagement with a thumbnail could potentially increase your overall revenue.

Under the Promotional Materials screen, add two different thumbnails for your island. Later, you can review the thumbnail metrics on the Publishing page to see which thumbnail has the higher click-through rate.

A/B-tested thumbnails are applied to the in-game Discover page, and to browse, and search. For more, see the **[A/B Thumbnail Testing](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/ab-thumbnail-testing-in-fortnite-creative)** document.

## Island Video

You can also use a trailer to advertise your island. Trailers play when a player clicks your island thumbnail in Discover and when a player visits your island page. Under **Media**, click **Add Trailer Video** to add a video.

When making a video trailer, keep in mind:

- **Keep it short.** Ideally, your video should be 15–30 seconds long.
- **What's important to highlight?** When setting up your scene, what are the important elements to showcase? What island feature are you especially proud of? Is there some aspect of your game that's particularly fun?
- **What's the best camera position to show this?** If you use Replays, for example, you can move your camera to show characters from any angle. Take advantage of this to set up shots that catch the viewer's attention.
- **Tell a story.** When appropriate, awaken your inner cinematographer and tell a story with your video. What will your characters be doing, and where are they going to do it?

Your goal is to catch the viewer's attention and interest them in checking out your island. And remember to add your island code so they can find it easily!

If you’re not sure how to make a video, see the **[Making Thumbnails and Videos](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-thumbnails-and-videos-in-fortnite-creative)** for best practices and tips for creating an engaging trailer for your island.

## Lobby Background Image

Lobby background images are images that appear in the lobby and replace the default lobby background when players hover or select an island from Discover or search. Lobby images can be taken with a special Fortnite tool that helps you capture an image of your island for the purpose of a background lobby image.

To learn how to take your own lobby background image, see **[Creating Custom Lobby Backgrounds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creating-custom-lobby-backgrounds-in-fortnite-creative)**.

There is no A/B testing for lobby images.
