Any device or setting that changes or modifies a player's ability to move — for better or worse — is a movement modifier. A number of [traps](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#trap) will slow or hinder a player's speed, but some [boosts](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#boost) will increase it.
