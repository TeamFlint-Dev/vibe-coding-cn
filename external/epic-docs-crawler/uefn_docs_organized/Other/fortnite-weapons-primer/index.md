A **weapon** is an [item](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#item) that a player can use to do damage to another [object](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#object) or player. Most weapons use some sort of ammunition (**ammo** for short) unless they are [melee weapons](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#melee-weapon), like swords or hammers.

Weapons can add a layer of interaction to your [game mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics), but to make the most of weapons in your gameplay, it helps to understand the factors that affect how they work.

## Finding Weapons

In **Fortnite Creative**, you can find weapons available in the Creative inventory by pressing the **Tab** key, then selecting **Content > Weapons** to open the Weapons category on the left.

[![Finding the weapons in Creative content.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4e855b31-f7d8-431a-a18b-5e9b7cf16a5d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4e855b31-f7d8-431a-a18b-5e9b7cf16a5d?resizing_type=fit)

*The (1) Content tab shows all of the (2) categories for Creative inventory. You can apply various (3) filters to limit the items that appear, or use the (4) search box to find a specific weapon by name.*

For more on how to use the **Content Browser** features, see [**Exploring the Content Browser Menu**](exploring-the-content-browser-menu-in-fortnite-creative).

## Weapon Characteristics

When you select the Weapons category, you can find details for any weapon by highlighting it then clicking the **Details** panel icon.

[![What the Weapons info panel reveals about a weapon.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/89b14c54-8aa7-41a7-aecc-2972a1efb366?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/89b14c54-8aa7-41a7-aecc-2972a1efb366?resizing_type=fit)

| # | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | Toggle for weapon **Details** panel. |
| **2** | The **weapon name** for the weapon you select. You can only select one weapon at a time. |
| **3** | This provides both the name of the [rarity](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer#rarity) value and the number of stars that represent that rarity. |
| **4** | The [type](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer) of weapon (subcategory), and a visual of the type of [ammo](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer) it uses. |
| **5** | A short **description** of the weapon. |
| **6** | The amount of **damage** the weapon deals against other players and the environment. |
| **7** | **Fire Rate** is how quickly the weapon can fire again after it is shot. The fire rate is measured in **RPS (rounds per second)**. |
| **8** | **Magazine Size** is how many rounds a weapon can hold. |
| **9** | **Reload Time** is how long it takes to recharge a weapon when ammo is out, measured in seconds. |

## Weapon Subcategories

**Weapons** is a category in the Creative inventory Contents tab and the Content Browser in UEFN, so different **types** of weapons are grouped into **subcategories**. Some weapons fall into more than one subcategory. Following are the basic groupings.

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Assault** | A type of rifle that's accurate, fully automatic, and fast-firing. It is good for medium to long-range, and uses [medium bullets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer). |
| **Bow** | A weapon that shoots [arrows](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer). |
| **Crossbow** | A type of bow that usually deals more damage than a regular bow. It also shoots arrows. |
| **Explosive** | An explosive weapon is one of a variety of weapons that launch explosive devices. Most explosive weapons launch [rockets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer). |
| **Melee** | This is a handheld weapon that can be used in close-range combat. Melee weapons don’t consume ammo, don’t need to be reloaded, and don’t ever break. |
| **Pistol** | A handgun that can be used at any range, but excels in close- to medium-range combat. Pistols are usually automatic or semi-automatic, although there are exceptions. Pistols usually use [light bullets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer). |
| **Rifle** | A rifle is usually used for taking down opponents from a distance. Depending on the type of rifle, it can use [light, medium, or heavy bullets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer). |
| **Shotgun** | Shotguns are good for close-range combat. Because they shoot their clusters of pellets in a cone shape that moves out from the weapon, the closer the shooter is to the target, the more pellets will strike the target, and more damage will be dealt. Shotguns use [shells](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-weapons-primer). |
| **SMG** | SMGs (submachine guns) shoot short bursts of rounds. An SMG is better in close range, and less accurate than most rifles over a distance. SMGs use **light bullets**. |
| **Utility** | Utility weapons are things that don't fit in any other subcategory. Examples would include the Kinetic Boomerang, Nitro Fists, and Shockwave Hammer, all of which have unique qualities. |

### Rarity

Weapons are ranked by **rarity**. The more rare a weapon is, the more powerful it is.

Rarity affects a weapon's damage, magazine capacity, and other factors, such as **spread** (how widely the ammo can move off trajectory — think shotguns!) and **recoil** (the amount of upward motion on a weapon when fired).

You can see a weapon's rarity by its label and how many stars it has.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| A **Mythic** weapon is the most rare and damaging of weapons. Mythic weapons have six stars. | **Legendary** is just under Mythic in rarity and gets five stars. | **Epic** is above average in rarity and has four stars. |
|  |  |  |
| **Rare** is in the middle in rarity, and is represented by three stars. | **Uncommon** is just above Common in rarity, and has two stars. | **Common** is the lowest rarity in a weapon. It is represented by one lonely star. |

## Filtering Weapon Searches

You can streamline weapon searches using the **search box** to enter a keyword. You can also use any of the options under the **Filter** tab.

Select **Union** to show all items from selected filters. Select **Intersect** to show items that include all of the selected filters.

[![There are many ways to control your view of weapons.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/392f4d09-7909-4dff-aabf-331222216779?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/392f4d09-7909-4dff-aabf-331222216779?resizing_type=fit)

## Types of Ammo

Different types of weapons use different types of **ammo**. There are six basic ammos.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |
| **Arrows** are ammo for bows and crossbows. | **Shells** are typically used in shotguns. | **Medium bullets** are for mid-range weapons like assault rifles. |
|  |  |  |
| **Light bullets** are typically for handguns or submachine guns (SMGs). | **Heavy bullets** are used in long-range weapons like sniper rifles. | **Rockets** are for weapons that shoot explosives, like rocket launchers. |

You can filter your weapons view based on the type of ammo a weapon uses.

To add ammo to your island, go to **Content > Items**, then **search** or **filter** to find the ammo you need.

### Infinite Ammo

You can equip a player with ammo for the weapons on your island, or you can provide infinite ammo, meaning the player doesn't have to be concerned about getting more ammo.

### Ammo Options with Island Settings

To provide infinite ammo for all weapons and all players, go to **Island Settings > Player > Inventory** and use the settings below to adjust how ammo is used on your island.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **No Cooldowns** | If this is set to **On**, cooldown timers will not start. This can also apply to some weapons, such as the Minigun. |
| **Infinite Items** | If set to **On**, players have infinite uses of items, such as grenades and shield potions. |
| **Infinite Reserve Ammo** | If set to **On**, players have infinite reserve ammo for most weapons, so they can always reload. |
| **Infinite Magazine Ammo** | If set to **On**, players have infinite loaded ammo for most weapons, so they don’t need to reload. |
| **Infinite Charges** | If set to **On**, players have infinite charges for weapons and items that use them, such as the Shockwave Hammer. |
| **Infinite Reserve Energy** | If set to **On**, players have infinite reserve energy for weapons and items that need to reload their energy, such as the Wings of Icarus. |
| **Infinite Loaded Energy** | If set to **On**, players have infinite loaded energy for weapons and items that use it, such as the Wings of Icarus. |

**Magazine ammo** is ammo that's loaded in the weapon, while **reserve ammo** is the ammo that a player has in inventory and that will be used to reload. **Infinite Reserve Ammo** means the player can always reload that kind of weapon, while **Infinite Magazine Ammo** means they never have to load the weapon in the first place.

### Infinite Ammo with Device Settings

Some devices, such as the [**Team Settings and Inventory**](using-team-settings-and-inventory-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [**Class Designer**](using-class-designer-devices-in-fortnite-creative) devices, also provide a way to assign infinite ammo without using Island Settings.

Using a device instead of the Island Settings also makes it possible to select which teams or players have infinite ammo while excluding other players or teams.

When mixing settings for your weapons between Island Settings and devices, it's helpful to understand how these settings interact.

- **Island Settings** are the baseline, meaning they apply to the entire island experience.
- **Team Settings and Inventory** overrides Island Settings if you set specific values in the device.
- **Class Designer** settings override both Island and Team and Inventory settings if you use different values in this device.

## Weapon Themes

Weapons have [themes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#island-theme) that coordinate with the themes used in [**starter islands**](building-your-first-island-in-fortnite-creative) and in [prefabs and galleries](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-prefabs-and-galleries-in-fortnite-creative).

For example, if you want to build a barnyard-based game, it would be more thematic to use an old shotgun as a weapon.

[![Barns and shotguns go together like cats and head scratches.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5534d427-1c85-4fad-ab84-187d7f16d020?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5534d427-1c85-4fad-ab84-187d7f16d020?resizing_type=fit)

Of course, if your game were along the lines of Aliens vs Farmers, it might be totally appropriate to use rayguns.

[![Rayguns work well with blue chickens. BawwkkkKK!](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/937a14f3-95ae-4f7e-85ef-af86837d6f7e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/937a14f3-95ae-4f7e-85ef-af86837d6f7e?resizing_type=fit)

When you're designing your own game, sometimes half the fun is breaking the rules!

Some weapons are categorized by their Battle Royale theme for the season they were a part of. Examples include MEGA and Wilds.

You can also use filters like **Recently Added** or **New This Season** to quickly find new weapons in the Creative inventory.

## Using Devices to Enhance Weapon Gameplay

There are multiple devices in Fortnite Creative that interact well with the weapons in your game. These range from devices that provide weapons to players at start of game or in-game to a way for players to modify weapons for a more tailored experience.

### Equipping Your Players with Weapons

The **Item Spawner** is a device that you can use to register weapons (and other items, including ammo!) on your island that players can then pick up during a game. See [Item Spawner Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) for more on using this device to equip players.

The **Item Granter** is another device that you can use to place weapons and other items (including ammo) directly into player inventories during a game. See [Item Granter Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative) for how to set up and customize this device.

A third device is the **Item Placer**. You can use this to place weapons and other items (including ammo) around the island. Players can then pick up these items in-game. See [Item Placer Devices](using-item-placer-devices-in-fortnite-creative) for more on how to use this device.

### Moddable Weapons

If you add a [Weapon Mod Bench](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-weapon-mod-bench-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to your island, players can use this in-game to customize their weapons.

[![The Weapon Mod Bench lets players modify their weapons in-game.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c56e30f3-725b-4a57-9c7a-265531121932?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c56e30f3-725b-4a57-9c7a-265531121932?resizing_type=fit)

You can customize the device itself in Create mode to control things like which players can access the bench.

[![When a player opens the mod bench, it will show the modifications available for the weapon the player is holding.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e05e4771-fe88-4a16-8508-4ba1e9f546ae?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e05e4771-fe88-4a16-8508-4ba1e9f546ae?resizing_type=fit)

Players with access to the Weapon Mod Bench can customize their weapons in-game using the bench. However, not all weapons in Fortnite can be modified. To see a complete list of moddable weapons, filter your weapon view with the **Modular** tag.

[![To see which weapons can be modified by the player, use the Modular tag to filter your weapons view.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f32e30ad-39a3-4e64-bf62-83d47e99ff94?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f32e30ad-39a3-4e64-bf62-83d47e99ff94?resizing_type=fit)

Weapons that cannot be modified include:

- Melee weapons
- Dual-wielded weapons (one weapon in each hand)
- Unique mythic weapons
- Weapons that were released before the Modular tag was used.

## For More Ideas

Different weapons have different quirks and features. The best way to discover these is to bring weapons onto your island and test them out. Nothing beats that hands-on experience for understanding the relative limitations and benefits of the hundreds of weapons available in Fortnite!
