As a creator, you can build islands with curated [assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#asset) designed around a particular brand that Epic has partnered with. These [brand islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#brand-island) offer players the chance to explore immersive, recognizable worlds.

You can access the feature set for each brand from Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). However, some assets and templates are only available in UEFN. You can start building the same as any Fortnite island.

From this page, learn how to access the brand content in Creative and UEFN, and how to enroll in the Island Creator Program with the correct agreements to publish brand islands.

## Brand Content in Creative

You can get started building in Creative, just like any other project, from the console.

To create a brand island:

1. Navigate to the console, and click **Create New**.
2. Click one of the brand tabs to see the available islands.
3. Select an island, and click **Confirm**.
4. Enter the golden rift.
