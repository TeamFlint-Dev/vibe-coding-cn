This device creates a zone that, when triggered, will switch a player to a different class. Used with the Class Designer, the Class Selector is used for a single class. You can add multiple devices if you want to make zones for different classes. This device is activated when a player passes through the zone.

For more on how to use these, see [Class Selector Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-class-selector-devices-in-fortnite-creative).
