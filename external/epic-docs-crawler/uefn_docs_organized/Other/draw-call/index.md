A draw call tells the graphics [API](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/verse-glossary#api) what to draw and how to draw it. Each draw call contains all the information the graphics API needs to draw on the screen, such as information about textures, shaders, and buffers. Draw calls can be resource-intensive, but often the preparation for a draw call is more resource-intensive than the draw call itself.
