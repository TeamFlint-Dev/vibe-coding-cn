The **Game Details** screen in Creator Portal is where you provide the information about your island that appears on your island page, in Discover, and on the loading screen. This includes:

1. **Title**
2. **Game Description**
3. **Island Tags**
4. **How To Play**

[![When you fill out the Game Details template, take your time and be thorough. This is part of marketing your island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b12e784b-d0b2-4a26-bfbf-25e8832f978f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b12e784b-d0b2-4a26-bfbf-25e8832f978f?resizing_type=fit)

## Title

The name of your island is important. It communicates the unique style of your island and suggests the creativity and thought that went into the creation of the game.

Your island name should go beyond the genre your island falls under. (You can identify the genre using **Game Tags** in the **Island Tags**.)

Titles go through a **[content pre-check](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-page-features-in-fortnite-creative)** that looks at whether your title is similar to one that is already published or if your title is misleading to players. In such cases, you are prompted to provide a new title.

If you submit an island that received a Similarity Warning without fixing the title, your island may get filtered out of the top rows in Discover when it gets published. For information on how Discover Filtering affects islands in Discover, see How Discover Works.

## Game Description

The game description should be specific to the island you created and not generic or misleading. Use the island description to attract players with witty wordplay and creative descriptions of the game mechanic.

The description should accomplish a couple of goals:

- **Engage Players**: Stand out in Discover with a great description that makes players choose your island over the others.
- **Pique Player Interest**: Write a clear, flashy description that helps your island stand out.

### Engage Players

Think about what makes your island fun to play. Are there surprises or a fun twist? Write about what sets your island apart from the others. A great introduction to your island starts with a hook that grabs player attention and curiosity.

A hook is brief, captivating, and designed to persuade players to play your game. Writing a great hook starts by understanding your audience and writing for them.

When writing a hook, keep it simple and relevant. Don’t lie to your potential players, build trust instead by making a connection through humor, excitement, or nostalgia.

You can also use your hook to mention your brand (if you have one).  And remember to add a call to action that tells the player to do something – ! – preferably on your island!

- “Get behind the wheel, push the pedal to the metal, and leave the competition in your dust! ”
- “Escape from the Funky Fjord Maze or become monster chow.”
- "Do you have what it takes to become a trusted assassin? Prove it at the Shoots First Resort!”

### Pique Player Interest

After your hook, write a detailed description of your island and its gameplay. Illustrate what sets your island apart from the other islands in the genre, this can be achieved by depicting a game mechanic unique to the island, or writing about the theming and art choices you committed to.

- “Get behind the wheel, push the pedal to the metal, and leave the competition in your dust!  Trick out your ride with custom decals, upgrades are available with each win.”
- “Escape from the Funky Fjord Maze or become monster chow. Sneak around the maze collecting health and items to help you survive the monsters blocking your path to freedom.”
- "Do you have what it takes to become a trusted assassin? Prove it at the Shoots First Resort! Accept challenges from the assassins at the resort and gain points and clout by helping the assassins achieve their petty revenge.”

## Island Tags

Tags help players find your island using Fortnite’s search tool.

Use the island tags to assign a game genre and describe gameplay. There are enough tags to ensure your island is assigned to the proper category and genre in Discover.

You can only assign a maximum of four tags to your Island Tags.

To learn more about game tags, see the **[Games and Game Tags page](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/games-and-game-tags-in-fortnite-creative)**.

## How to Play

These instructions appear as bullet points on the island loading screen. Use these bullet points to set expectations by letting players know what they’ll experience while on your island and what they can expect from the gameplay.

Below the fields for the metadata, enter notes under **What has changed from the previous release**. You are required to list user-facing updates to the island content. This field is not viewable by players, but will be reviewed by Epic and IARC rating authorities.

Once you’ve filled out all the fields on the **Game Details** screen, click **Next** to move onto the [Rating screen](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/rating-screen-in-fortnite).

## Content Pre-Checks

Titles and promotional images go through a series of content pre-checks during the submission process. These pre-checks can help you identify and fix issues before submitting your island for content review.

When you enter your game title or upload promotional images for your island, they’ll be scanned to make sure they’re not misleading and that they’re not too similar to something another creator has already published.  If they are, you’ll be prompted to  provide a new title or image.

The pre-checks will result in one of the following states:

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State | Image | Description |
| Success | [An example of a successful content pre-check.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8a0f8cc1-074f-4b23-9ab2-f3f821861343?resizing_type=fit)  Click image to enlarge. | Promotional content has successfully passed pre-checks. |
| Content Rule Warning | [An example of a pre-check content warning.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d2d1517b-3959-4fb5-8620-04aa120819e9?resizing_type=fit)  Click image to enlarge. | Promotional content may have an issue. You may proceed with submission, but your release may fail content review. |
| Similarity Warning | [An example of a pre-check similarity warning.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cfc8530f-dafb-405f-aff7-589dc8fb45ae?resizing_type=fit)  Click image to enlarge. | Promotional content is too similar to another creator’s content. You can proceed with submission, but your island may have reduced visibility in Discover. |
| Blocked | [An example of a blocked pre-check.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b1a10c9b-62a9-4229-8c0d-b0727432ffc1?resizing_type=fit)  Click image to enlarge. | Promotional content violates a content rule. You cannot continue with submission until you fix the issue. |

## Discover Filtering

If you choose to submit your island without fixing content that received a Similarity Warning, your island may get filtered out of top rows in Discover when it gets published. For information on how Discover Filtering affects islands in Discover, see **[How Discover Works](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/how-discover-works-in-fortnite)**.

If you or your team are the original creators of the content that matches or nearly matches an existing island, you will not receive a content pre-check warning. You won’t be blocked from publishing or filtered from Discover. In other words, creators of original content are able to publish titles and thumbnails that are highly similar to their existing islands.BlockThe original creator of a given title or thumbnail is determined using the following criteria:

- **Thumbnails**: The creator or team that first published the thumbnail in the Fortnite ecosystem.
- **Titles**: The creator or team who published an island that either had 100 unique users in the last 96 hours, or accumulated at least 150 minutes of editing time on the project in the last 30 days.
