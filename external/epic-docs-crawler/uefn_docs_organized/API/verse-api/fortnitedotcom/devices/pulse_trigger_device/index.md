### Functions

| Function Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`Begin`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/begin) | Starts the damage pulse. |
| [`Disable`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/disable) | Disables this device. |
| [`Enable`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/enable) | Enables this device. |
| [`End`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/end) | Stops the damage pulse. |
| [`GetDamage`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/getdamage) | Returns the damage to be applied to those hit by an active pulse. Clamped between `0 <= GetDamage <= 100000`. |
| [`GetLoopCount`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/getloopcount) | Returns the total number of times this pulse will complete before ending. `0` indicates the pulse will continue indefinitely. |
| [`GetTransform`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/gettransform) | Returns the transform of the `creative_object` with units in cm. You must check `creative_object.IsValid` before calling this if there is a possibility the object has been disposed or destroyed by gameplay. Otherwise a runtime error will result. |
| [`GetWaveSpeed`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/getwavespeed) | Returns the speed (in meters per second) at which the pulses generated by this pulse trigger will travel. |
| [`MoveTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/moveto) | Moves the `creative_object` to the specified `Position` and `Rotation` over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the `creative_object` it will be stopped and put into the `AnimationNotSet` state. |
| [`MoveTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/moveto-1) | Moves the `creative_object` to the specified `Transform` over the specified time, in seconds. If an animation is currently playing on the `creative_object` it will be stopped and put into the `AnimationNotSet` state. |
| [`ResumePulse`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/resumepulse) | Resumes the damage pulse from the last position where it was stopped. |
| [`ResumeSequence`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/resumesequence) | This function is deprecated. Use `ResumePulse` instead of this. Resumes the damage sequence from the last position where it was stopped. |
| [`SetDamage`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/setdamage) | Sets the damage to be applied to those hit by an active pulse. Clamped between `0 <= GetDamage <= 100000`. Pulse visuals will change to reflect whether the pulse causes damage or not. |
| [`SetLoopCount`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/setloopcount) | Sets the total number of times this pulse will complete before ending. `LoopCount = 0` indicates the pulse should continue indefinitely. |
| [`SetWaveSpeed`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/pulse_trigger_device/setwavespeed) | Sets the speed (in meters per second) at which the pulses generated by this pulse trigger will travel. |
| [`TeleportTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/teleportto) | Teleports the `creative_object` to the specified `Position` and `Rotation`. |
| [`TeleportTo`](/documentation/en-us/fortnite/verse-api/fortnitedotcom/devices/creative_object/teleportto-1) | Teleports the `creative_object` to the specified location defined by `Transform`, also applies rotation and scale accordingly. |
