Embrace the spooky season with the Scarecrow hiding prop now available in the v31.40 update. Use this prop from the **Hiding Props Gallery** device to hide with your friends from surrounding terrors. You can also dash to nearby safety with the Battle Royale Ch5S2 **River Styx** and **Red River Styx** water volumes.

## New Scarecrow Hiding Prop

Access the Scarecrow hiding prop within the **Hiding Props Gallery** device. All the standard hiding prop options, events, and functions are available. Uniquely, the first player to enter the individual hiding prop will be able to control its rotation.
