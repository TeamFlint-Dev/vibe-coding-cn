## Create Fall Guys Islands in Fortnite with UEFN and Creative!

[![Fortnite character as a Fall Guys bean](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/88d011b7-ffe8-443d-9d28-ae31379b98fd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/88d011b7-ffe8-443d-9d28-ae31379b98fd?resizing_type=fit)

You can now make Fall Guys obstacle courses in Fortnite! When you start a new project using the **Fall Guys template**, you’ll get access to a large selection of Fall Guys assets straight from the Blunderdome. Even better, all player characters will look, feel, and even move like the Beans you know and love from Fall Guys Original!

As part of the special templates, you have access to a large selection of prefabs and galleries, filled with pieces you can use to build custom Fall Guys-style obstacle courses. The obstacles and building components come in various sizes to fit your island's needs.

[![Fall Guys Obstacles Gallery](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c1e987f3-e8b1-427e-a97c-8261029d97d1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c1e987f3-e8b1-427e-a97c-8261029d97d1?resizing_type=fit)

You will be able to publish your Fall Guys islands starting August 6 in the [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome) — these islands won’t auto-publish so you’ll need to do it manually. Islands created with the Fall Guys starter islands may qualify for placement in a limited-time Fall Guys row in Discover.

We want to hear from you! As you’re building Fall Guys islands, feel free to provide feedback about the starter islands/templates, the tools, and the Bean character to the [EDC Forum Fall Guys Tools: Feedback Thread](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/fall-guys-tools-feedback-thread/1940690) so we can continue to improve them with your help!

## New Side Scroller Controls and Orthographic Cameras Settings

Create Side Scrollers and retro-style, 2D isometric gameplay using the new [Side Scroller Controls Device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/using-side-scroller-controls-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and Orthographic Camera settings in Creative and UEFN. The Side Scroller Controls device can be used with the Orthographic Camera device option on Fixed Angle, Fixed Perspective, and Orbit cameras to clamp a player to a directional axis.

### Side Scroller Controls Device (Early Access)

The Side Scroller Controls device is in Early Access. **Early Access** means we’re giving you an opportunity to try out a feature that’s still under development. By releasing a device as Early Access, our aim is to put exciting new features and devices into your hands as soon as their core functionality can be used effectively. We’ll take any feedback you provide to improve the device for final release.

The Side Scroller Controls device can be paired with the Fixed Angle and Fixed Point Camera devices to create side scroller gameplay. You can use the Side Scroller Controls device to clamp the player character's movement and/or facing to a directional axis.

[![The Side Scroller Controls Device can be paired with the Fixed Angle and Fixed Point Camera Devices to create side scroller gameplay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/02da8820-a613-4b24-9b0f-3329a728c75e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/02da8820-a613-4b24-9b0f-3329a728c75e?resizing_type=fit)

### Orthographic Camera Settings Added to Fixed Point, Fixed Angle, and Orbit Cameras

Using the Orthographic Camera device option removes all perspective from the camera’s view. You can also adjust the width and rotation of the orthographic view. This is useful for making isometric or 2D games, or used with the Side Scroller Controls device to make retro-style side scroller games.

## New Scene Graph Platformer Tutorial

Use the power of Scene Graph to create a platformer! In the [Scene Graph Platformer Tutorial](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/create-a-platformer-with-scene-graph-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite), you’ll create custom Verse components to build platform behaviors, like moving back and forth, resetting, and disappearing on a loop! You’ll then iterate on these components to quickly build a platformer level! This tutorial is a great place to start learning how to use Verse with Scene Graph and create your own custom components.

## New Devices and Items

### Creator Profile Link Device

Place the [Creator Profile Link](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/using-creator-profile-link-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device on your island to give players a way to discover more about you and your islands. In-game, the device displays a QR code that directs players to the island owner’s site on Fortnite.com. The creator’s page lets players see and discover other islands from the same creator, connect to the creator on social media, and learn more about the type of islands that creator likes to make.

### Save Point Device Updates

The **Save Scoreboard Stats Behavior** device option was added so you can choose from saving round stats, career stats, or both. This makes it easier to save career scores while also using score as a condition for ending the round.

### Creator Most Wanted Weapons and Items
