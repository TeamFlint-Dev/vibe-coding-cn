We've combined Patch Notes and Release Notes into one document! Now you can read all about the updates and changes right here on the Epic Developer Community!

In the Fortnite Ecosystem v30.20 update, there are three new templates for you to create projects from and explore. Check out the Talisman templates and learning materials to see how we transformed the [GDC demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqaXsbAss3s) into two templates that showcase realistic environments and dynamically clothed MetaHumans. Also check out the Speedway Race with Verse Persistence template, a racing game example with a persistent local leaderboard and round-specific logic.

## Talisman Templates

Today, you can dive into two new Talisman templates to discover how dynamically clothed MetaHumans, realistic environments, and clever optimization techniques can be used to create distinct and high-fidelity Fortnite islands. To learn more about all the new Talisman content and Marvelous Designer licenses, [check out the blog post](https://create.fortnite.com/news/new-talisman-demo-templates-now-available-for-uefn).

We've split the Talisman demo into two separate templates. The [Talisman: Environment](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/talisman-environment-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) template showcases the high-fidelity spaceship environment in which the demo is set. You can walk around and explore the ship, and access the [Talisman Asset Art Gallery](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/talisman-art-asset-gallery-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to view and use all the props and assets designed for the ship.

The [Talisman: MetaHuman](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/talisman-metahuman-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) template features the MetaHuman "Captain Roux" from the demo. After a brief interaction and cinematic, you can inspect the MetaHuman to examine the clothing up close and learn how we optimized the MetaHuman for Fortnite.

### Talisman Learning Materials

The new [Realistic Assets, Characters, and Environments](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/uefn/realistic-assets-characters-environments-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) documentation section teaches you about bringing high-fidelity assets into UEFN. You can learn more about each template, optimizing your islands, adding clothing to a MetaHuman using Unreal Engine 5 and Marvelous Designer, transitioning the player's point of view using cameras, and more. Check it out now!

## Speedway Race with Verse Persistence Template

The introduction of Verse Persistence led to the upgrade of the Fortnite Creative "Design a Speedway Race" template island to UEFN. Cinematics and custom landscapes were added, and triggers were moved into Verse. Check out the **Speedway Race with Verse Persistence** template in UEFN today!

Get the [inside story](https://create.fortnite.com/news/how-we-improved-the-speedway-race-template-in-fortnite-with-verse-persistence-and-more) on how we updated the Speedway Race template for use in UEFN, and explore the upgrades we made, like the implementation of Verse Persistence.

## Creative and UEFN Updates and Fixes

**Fixes**:

- The Report screen no longer stays open after a player is eliminated.
- Fixed an issue where the Playset setting in UEFN's World Settings was causing validation issues when using Icons.

### Devices

**Fixes**:

- Fixed an issue with the Objective device's collision when set to everything and when there were visibility-based collision changes.
- Fixed an issue where the Save Point device's **Save Full Ammo Magazines** option only worked when the device's **Auto Save** option was set to **Enabled**. It now works regardless of the value set in the Auto Save option.
- Fixed an issue where the Player Reference device was occasionally not loading the player model.

## UEFN Updates and Fixes

**New**:

- UEFN now validates that imported textures meet streaming and size requirements to ensure that all islands work well on all platforms.
- `All Classes` is now exposed in the Placement Tool.
- Added a small plain white cubemap to the base content to allow users to create solid color ambient lighting. You can find the asset at **/Epic/Textures/Blanks/T\_Default\_Cubemap\_White**.

**Fixes:**

- UEFN now prompts you to save changes if servers are taken offline or network connection is lost after startup.
- Fixed an issue that prevented polygroup colors from displaying in the Simplify and Remesh tools.
- Fixed a crash when resizing the brush using the **B** hotkey in the Edit Materials tool.

## Verse Updates and Fixes

**Fixes**:

- Added warning C6393: A lookup table of size 365 is not sufficient to handle leap years. This is a warning that goes off if any static array is 365 members long. The intent of the warning is to stop common misuse of static arrays to look up days of the year. In practice someone hitting this could just disable the warning locally to approve the array and remove the warning. In our case though the code generation step can easily generate arrays 365 members long and there is no (good) way to fix it. So turning it off globally makes the most sense.
- Fixed issue with Verse class and struct memory statistics. The size of the whole chunk was being repeated for each Verse class or struct in the chunk.
- Fixed issue where, if the default class value for a var is changed in Verse, then the level would fail to cook.
