The 30.40 update brings you the ability to publish your Fall Guys islands along with six new sample islands to inspire your own creations. Be sure to check out the Fall Guys Verse tutorial and our educational design examples that guide you through using devices to recreate popular gameplay mechanics.

This release also brings you closer to your creative neighbors with the introduction of Proximity Chat. Popular Battle Royale items such as Diamond's Thermal DMR have also been added.

In this update, we’ve also combined Patch Notes and Release Notes into one document! Now you can read all about the updates and changes in one place on the Epic Developer Community!

## Publish Your Fall Guys Islands!

Starting today, August 6th, at 9 AM ET you can publish your Creative and UEFN Fall Guys islands for players around the world to enjoy! Publishing a Fall Guys island through the Creator Portal follows the same process and rulesets as publishing any other Creative or UEFN island.

Important reminders:

- Creators have frequently asked if the phrase "Fall Guys" is allowed in island names - the answer is yes, it is!
- You may not, however, use the official Fall Guys logo.

## New Fall Guys Islands Are Now Available to Play!

We have also launched six brand new UEFN Fall Guys islands to sprout more of your own fantastic creations. Each of these islands showcases the Bean's abilities in different ways while testing your platforming skills to the limit!

- **Blunderdome Blast:** It's team vs. team as you launch your [Bean](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/fortnite-creative-glossary#bean) from cannons to destroy structures.

- **Bean Circuit:** Run, jump, dive, and mantle around the Bean Circuit to get the best time as you climb the leaderboard. This island features multiple obstacles, speed boosts, and a quick restart option. **Island Code: 0057-3389-4313**
- **Pegwin Pickup:** Can you find the Pegwins in this island’s three arenas? Compete with other players to find them in the fastest time possible and take your rightful place at the top of the podium. **Island Code: 7485-7322-4774**

## Proximity Chat offers new Voice Chat Options! (Early Access)

You can now use the **Proximity Chat** option in **Island Settings** under **Voice Chat**. Creators can control the full volume range and additional distance over which the volume gradually drops to zero. Proximity Chat only affects the **Game Channel**.

When Proximity Chat is enabled on the island, a mandatory HUD element is enabled that shows players who are actively speaking. Voice reporting, muting, and blocking all work in conjunction with this feature. Epic moderates all proximity chat reports to address any violation of our [Community Rules](https://www.epicgames.com/site/community-rules).

Proximity Chat is currently available as **Early Access** to give you an opportunity to try out this feature that’s still under development. By releasing this as Early Access, we aim to put exciting new features into your hands as soon as the core functionality can be used effectively. We’ll be reviewing your feedback and improving the feature for the final release in the coming months.

## New Device Design Examples

We've added new [device design examples](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative) to the Fortnite Creative documentation, focusing on game mechanic tutorials that showcase different Creative devices. The following is the list of new device design examples. Take a look at these tutorials to get inspiration on different ways to use Creative devices!

- [**ATK Spawner Device Design Example**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/atk-spawner-device-design-examples-in-fortnite-creative): Create the Great ATK Collectibles Race by using several devices to create a fun multiplayer-team game. The game is constructed around a "hidden" feature of the ATK — players can use the awning on the top of the kart as a bounce pad!
- [**Campfire Device Design Example**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/campfire-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative): Use the **Campfire** device to create a puzzle mini-game that players can use to open a secret room they can then explore. Initially, the room will be underwater, but when a player lights the campfire, the water will drain out and they can access the hidden room!
- [**Explosive Device Design Example**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/explosive-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative): Explore a simple mechanic that you can use to add a bubbling visual effect to an explosive barrel that warns players it's about to explode!
- [**Grind Rail Device Design Example**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/grind-rail-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative): Create a Grind Park mini-game based on grinding the rails for points.
- [**Grind Vine Device Design Example**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/grind-vine-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative): Create a Grind Vine shooter mini-game where a player grinds through a swampy path while shooting targets along the way. The game awards points based on how quickly a player completes the course, and bonus points for shooting dangerous plants along the way.
- [**Item Remove Device Design Example**](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite-creative/item-remover-device-design-example-in-fortnite-creative): Set up an Item Remover device to work with a **Down But Not Out** device. This simple game mechanic will force players to drop whatever weapons and items they are carrying if their health drops to zero.

More examples are routinely added to this section of the Creative documentation, so keep a lookout!
