## Build The Walking Dead Universe Islands in Fortnite

[![Screenshot of The Walking Dead Universe assets used in a Fortnite island](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/34a0a971-c09e-4e8c-9a56-2d1736d5db60?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/34a0a971-c09e-4e8c-9a56-2d1736d5db60?resizing_type=fit)

You can now create The Walking Dead Universe (TWDU) islands for Fortnite using UEFN and Fortnite Creative (starting around 9AM ET). This update includes two new UEFN templates (Prison Starter and Walker NPC) to help you get started, along with Walker NPCs, unique Walking Dead Universe-themed weapons, prefabs, galleries, and a new post-processing effect (Heavy Linework comic-themed) for both UEFN and Creative.

To publish your The Walking Dead Universe islands, you’ll need to opt in to additional terms and conditions in the [Creator Portal](https://create.fortnite.com/welcome) that confirm you agree to share 12% of your engagement payout for TWDU islands with Skybound (see [fee schedule](https://create.fortnite.com/news/ip-partner-fee-schedule)). If you’ve already opted in to the terms and conditions to publish Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or LEGO® islands, you don’t need to re-sign. You’ll also need to make sure your island adheres to the [The Walking Dead Universe Brand and Creator Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/the-walking-dead-universe-brand-and-creator-rules-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite).

Dive in (if you dare) and begin building today. You’ll be able to publish your TWDU islands starting May 16 in the Creator Portal. Head over to the [TWDU blog](https://create.fortnite.com/news/the-walking-dead-universe-lurches-into-uefn-and-fortnite-creative) at around 9 AM ET to get all of the details!

### The Walking Dead Universe Templates for UEFN

[![Screenshot from the Walker NPC project template for The Walking Dead Universe](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/60369710-6d71-4786-aee3-f4f8c1b3df17?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/60369710-6d71-4786-aee3-f4f8c1b3df17?resizing_type=fit)

The [Walker NPC Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/twdu-walker-npc-template-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) offers you simple but effective game design insights and tips by cleverly utilizing the weapon mechanics of the Shiva Shotgun and Lucille in combination with a guide on how to spawn Walkers in interesting and exciting ways. It also introduces a custom HUD UI and cool comic book post-processing effects. You can also learn how to use first- and third-person [cameras](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/the-walking-dead-universe-cameras-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) to really show off how scary Walkers can be!

### The Walking Dead Universe Assets

## The LEGO Action Adventure Template Comes to Unreal Editor for Fortnite!

In the new Action Adventure template, there’s all-new content to explore to build your own classic LEGO adventure experience!

- Create custom quests with custom Verse devices.
- Use brand-new character classes and NPC behaviors, including an Attack Controller.
- Give your Minifigures new shiny studs to collect with the LEGO Collectible device.

To learn more, check out the [Action Adventure Template](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-action-adventure-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) and [LEGO Collectible Devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-lego-collectible-devices-in-fortnite-creative) documentation.

## LEGO Assembly Device Updates

The Assembly device has some quality-of-life updates! You can now select volume shapes — you’ve got three options. In UEFN, there’s a new setting for previewing material so you can customize the holographic preview.

## Spawn Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Characters in Creative!

You can now spawn Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) characters using devices in Fortnite Creative! TMNT character cosmetics options (Foot Clan/Shredder/Super Shredder) can now be selected in a TMNT project or island on the following devices:

- Character device
- Character Controller device
- Dance Mannequin device
- Guard Spawner device

## Access Brand Islands from any Island Template!

In UEFN, you can now use a wide range of templates as a starting point for building islands with brand-specific content. This feature brings the selection of the partners we offer in the Brand Templates section to starter islands.

When creating a starter island from the Island Templates section, you can use the **Brand Selection** dropdown to choose from the brands currently in Fortnite:

- Fortnite (default)
- Fall Guys
- LEGO® Islands
- The Walking Dead Universe
- TMNT

You will need to have signed the IP Partner Agreement Addendum to access and publish Brand islands. When creating a project, the island template becomes the selected brand type and cannot be changed or reverted. The project will have access to all content specific to that brand, and your island will be subject to the rules, restrictions and publishing conditions of that partner. Please refer to each **Brand and Creator Rules** page for specifics on rules for that brand.

## Favorite a Creator from the Creator Profile Link Device

[![Screenshot showing the Favorite Creator button in the Creator Profile device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a5f23c2-daca-4cc4-89bd-ce3686261fb3?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/3a5f23c2-daca-4cc4-89bd-ce3686261fb3?resizing_type=fit)

Players in Creative and UEFN islands can now favorite a creator from the Creator Profile Link device if one is placed in the island, instead of needing to return to the lobby to add a favorite.

## Creator Portal Updates

Your favorite count is now displayed on your Creator Page in Fortnite. Don’t forget to go smash that Favorite button for your favorite creators today!

Plus, the **Impressions** and **Clicks** charts now feature three new filters – **Sources**, **Countries**, and **Platforms**. You can better understand where players are seeing and clicking on your thumbnails from, the countries they play from, and the platforms they use.

## Fortnite Ecosystem Updates and Fixes

**New:**

- Changed **Potential Earnings** to **Potential Engagement Payout** in the island creation menus.
- Adjusted the following device options on the Automated Turret device to provide specific individual values available:

  - Activation Radius
  - Max Target Distance
  - Device Health
  - Disabled Duration
  - Wire Angle
  - Turret Damage
  - Idle Rotation Angle
- Upgraded the Changing Booth device to use the same locker experience as the lobby. Introduced vehicles as an option in the Changing Booth. Now players can change vehicle cosmetics using the Changing Booth, instead of having to exit to the lobby!
- Created normalized and delta values for Health and Shield options in the HUD Controller device:

  - Health Delta
  - Health Normalized
  - Health Delta Normalized
  - Shield Delta
  - Shield Normalized
  - Shield Delta Normalized
- The following improvement has been made to both the Guard Spawner device and the NPC Spawner device:

  - Added a new **Use Device Spawn Location** user/device option.
  - When this option is set to **On** (the default setting), it will use the device location as the spawn location. If the NPC is supposed to spawn on a Patrol Path (for example, if you are using the AI Patrol Path Node device), the **Use Device Spawn Location** option will not work.
  - When this option is set to **Off**, the device will use the **Spawn Radius** option value to determine spawn locations.
  - Any live islands and UEFN projects that were saved prior to 34.20 will have this new option set to **Off** by default.

**Fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where a grass fire was not clearing when the game ended.
- Fixed an issue where an Earth Sprite's ambient VFX was not visible in Edit mode.
- Fixed an issue where some visual effects on the Bank Vault device were only playing once.
- Fixed an issue where wide items, such as the Bandage Bazooka, were off-centered in devices like the Item Spawner device while editing an island.
- Fixed an issue where Bank Vault devices might not start, finish, or show the correct progress bar when two vaults had overlapping progress zones.
- Fixed an issue where the Bank Vault device's first weakpoint would sometimes become vulnerable to external damage immediately when the vault was activated, without waiting for the animation to finish.
- Fixed an issue where the players feet would stay aligned with angled surfaces even after moving into the air.
- Fixed an issue where some chests in the Chest and Ammo Gallery did not have a chest icon when revealed.
- Fixed an issue where the Storm Flip was not affecting guards.
- Added a device/user option to specify a mesh for the LEGO Assembly device's Include Volume.
- Players are now not able to emote while possessing a prop with a Prop-o-Matic.
- The Mutator Zone device now supports using the **On Player Entered** and **On Player Exited** events on test players.
- Fixed an issue where the Post-Process device's **Priority** option value was not applied when it was changed.
- Fixed an issue with the Team Settings & Inventory device, where the **Team Member Spawned** event was incorrectly triggered twice.

## Brand Island Updates and Fixes

### The Walking Dead Universe Known Issues

- Incorrectly named “Zombie” SoundCue assets appear in the Audio folder. These will be removed in a future release. Workaround: Use the identical **Walker** SoundCue assets in the **Walkers** folder instead.

### LEGO Islands

**New:**

- Added new thumbnails for LEGO Brand UEFN templates.
- Exposed the LEGO Assembly device hologram material to UEFN.

**Fixes:**

- Implemented LEGO crossbow firing and impact sounds.
- The LEGO Assembly device no longer blocks pickaxe swings.
- Fixed an issue where the correct material was not set on a dropped LEGO crossbow.
- Changed the Assembly device hologram so that it moves when the original object moves.

## UEFN Updates and Fixes

**New:**

- UEFN creators can now set up HUD Controller visibilities by player through the Verse API.

**Fixes:**

- Using Push Changes for a map material no longer crashes the game.
- Added protections to avoid a crash caused by a game controller reconnecting.
- Removed unnecessary warnings related to missing asset tags in the Texture Validator.
- In the Texture Validator, updated the tooltip warning for when a texture's LOD Bias needs updating.
- Fixed an issue where the mouse inputs won't be acknowledged in special cases like using scrcpy to simulate the input.
- Fixed an issue with a UEFN Validation Error related to the Patchwork Music Manager.
- Fixed a UI bug in the Details panel regarding nested containers that would not refresh properly when edited. For example: A 2D array (an array of arrays) would not update in the Details panel when you added an element to the array elements. This is now working correctly..
- Fixed a crash that occurred when undoing or copy-pasting landscapes.
- Fixed an issue that allowed UMaterialExpressionPinBase deletion by the user, which would make the composite expression invalid.
- Fixed an issue that prevented undo, redo, copy, and paste operations in material function editing to work reliably. This caused data invalidations, crashes and various unexpected behaviors.

## Verse Updates and Fixes

### API Updates

- Added a **Can Be Damaged** variable to Creative props through Verse. Now you can spawn props dynamically and toggle their damageable state!

### Verse Language

**New:**

- Concrete classes must now have default values for all data fields, including those defined in interfaces. If the code doesn't compile due to this error, you can choose to not make the class concrete, or to add an override of the data field in the class with a default value.

**Fixes:**

- Fixed an issue with qualifiers being disallowed when defining type aliases.
