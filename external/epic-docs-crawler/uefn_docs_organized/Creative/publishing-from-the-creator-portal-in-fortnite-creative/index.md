You’ve tinkered with the tools, devices, and assets to build the game of your dreams. You’ve created at least one island and [signed up for the Fortnite Island Creator Program](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/island-creator-and-engagement-program-in-fortnite-creative). 
Now you’re ready to take that next step and publish your island.

Keep in mind that your island must comply with the [Island Creator Rules](https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-creative-creator-content-rules-and-guidelines) before it can be considered for publishing.

After your island is out there, you can (and should!) continue to iterate and manage your island’s Discover thumbnail and trailer video from the Creator Portal.

## The Publishing Workflow

When you're ready to reveal your island to the world, start the publishing process from Fortnite Creative or UEFN.

### Initiate the Publishing Process

From **Fortnite Creative**, go to **Creative Island Settings** > **Overview**, and click **Publish Island**.

From **UEFN**, click the **Project** dropdown in the toolbar, then select **Publish Project**. This creates a new private version code.

### Publish in Creator Portal

Once you’re in the **[Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#creator-portal)**, you’re ready to create a new release and submit it for moderation.  To create a new release from your private version, follow these steps.

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Projects** to open the **Projects page**.

   [![Select a project to publish from the Projects page.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5258e98a-9f14-46b6-a737-a0f6f00c7247?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5258e98a-9f14-46b6-a737-a0f6f00c7247?resizing_type=fit)

2. Click on a project tile to open the island's **Publishing** page.

   [![From the project navigation select Publish.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5e147d4a-c1df-4656-93dd-476988ded5e3?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5e147d4a-c1df-4656-93dd-476988ded5e3?resizing_type=fit)

   Click image to enlarge.
3. Click the **Private Versions** screen. Select a private version from the list and click **Create release**. A pop-up will open as your selected version is validated for publishing eligibility.

4. Fix any errors that arise, then click Continue. The Publishing flow will open on the Game Details screen.

   [![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/92b83524-6d00-48f8-9814-b24cf76250ac?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/92b83524-6d00-48f8-9814-b24cf76250ac?resizing_type=fit)

   If your private version contains experimental features, you will not be able to create a release from a private version. If you try to initiate the Create Release workflow, a warning will display during validation to remind you that islands with experimental features cannot be published.

   [![Example of project with experimental features warning](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/920f1266-c631-456b-9faa-3cc346358bd6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/920f1266-c631-456b-9faa-3cc346358bd6?resizing_type=fit)
5. Fill out the island’s public metadata under **Game Details** and click **Next** to move to the **Rating** screen.

   [![Add metadata in the Game Details screen.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c91a1d6e-0414-408b-ac58-d61a0f995820?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c91a1d6e-0414-408b-ac58-d61a0f995820?resizing_type=fit)

   Island titles and thumbnails go through a series of content pre-checks before approval and advancing the publishing flow. For information on Discover filtering and how it affects islands in Discover, see [How Discover Works](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/how-discover-works-in-fortnite).
6. Provide the requested email addresses for ratings-related communications, then click **Begin Questionnaire**. You receive a message that you are leaving the Creator Portal, and being redirected to the IARC questionnaire.

   [![Enter an email address for IARC to contact you.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/931cd1ff-3c59-4507-8983-89b68b9da90f?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/931cd1ff-3c59-4507-8983-89b68b9da90f?resizing_type=fit)

If one of the publishing screens is missing information, a red exclamation mark appears next to the screen.
