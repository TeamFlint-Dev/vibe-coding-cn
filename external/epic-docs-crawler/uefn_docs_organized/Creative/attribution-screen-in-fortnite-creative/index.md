With Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) you can import [assets](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-glossary#asset) from [Fab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fab/fab-documentation) or other gaming asset marketplaces. Using third-party content is both a way to expand your island beyond the familiar Fortnite aesthetic, and a way to promote other creators by using their creations.

Attributing assets to their creators is an important part of the island publishing process. Attribution means acknowledging the source of another creator’s content and having that attribution visible in-game.

Keep in mind that the Attribution screen is provided for creator convenience only. You are responsible for complying with the requirements of any licenses you are a party to, and Epic does not guarantee that the Attribution screen will meet those requirements.

## Adding an Attribution

The **Attribution** template provides a way to attribute all third-party assets used in your project. To source any third-party licensed assets used, click Add Attribution. The Attribution dialog box where you’ll enter the attribution information for each third-party asset into each field opens.

[![Add the attribution information to the form.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/91aadf44-d919-41b9-ba65-2ee0176aabb6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/91aadf44-d919-41b9-ba65-2ee0176aabb6?resizing_type=fit)

You can list up to **50** total attributions. Click **Add Attribution** for each asset you used. A form opens with the following required fields:

- Content Title
- Content Source (URL where the content can be found)
- Content Author
- License holder name
- License type

[![Add the attribution information to the form.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a202a649-7523-4156-b1e9-e79b50a42b1c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a202a649-7523-4156-b1e9-e79b50a42b1c?resizing_type=fit)

Click **Continue** to close the attribution box.

By inspecting an asset in **[Fab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fab-user-interface-reference-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite)**, you’ll find the information on the right side of the inspection panel that you need.

You may have to search for the required information in other marketplaces to fill out the form.

The information and links you provided are added to your project’s island details page on [Fortnite.com](https://www.fortnite.com/). However, only the information you provide for an asset’s attribution is available through Discover in Fortnite.
