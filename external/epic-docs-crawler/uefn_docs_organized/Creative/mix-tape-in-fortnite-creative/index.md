In this example, players are invited to take part in a musical experience.

The creator’s goal in Mix Tape is to create an interactive environment where players step onto the Sequencer trap device and music begins playing. After creating this example, you will know how to use the Sequencer trap device, the Billboard device, and the Music Block Gallery.

- **1 x** [Player Spawn Pad device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative)

The Sequencer trap device can also be used as a trap in different gameplay examples. You can use the Sequencer volumes of the device to create a pulse that other devices react to, to cause damage to players with traps, or to set off connected devices.

## Galleries Used

The following gallery was used for this example:

- **MusicBlock Gallery**: Musical notes that create music when placed together.

## Instructions

Each of the devices you need for this gameplay example is described below.

### Placing the Gallery

1. Press **Tab** to open the [Creative Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
2. Click **Galleries > MusicBlock Gallery > EQUIP** to add the gallery to your **Quick Bar**.

   [![Find MusicBlock Gallery under the Gallery tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ab53db67-4c87-419b-9fcc-c3ff76528993?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ab53db67-4c87-419b-9fcc-c3ff76528993?resizing_type=fit)

   *Click to enlarge image.*
3. Click **Back** to enter [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode).
4. Press **1** and left-click to add the whole gallery to the map.

   If you know which music notes and sounds you want, you can instead click **OPEN** to see the whole gallery and select which notes/sounds you want to add to the Sequencer device.

### Placing the Sequencer Device

1. Press **Tab** to open the Creative Inventory again.
2. Click **Devices > Sequencer > Equip** to add the **Sequencer** device to your **Quick Bar**.
3. Repeat the previous instructions to add the **Billboard** device and the **Player Spawn Pad** device to your **Quick Bar**.
4. Click **Place Now** to go back to Create mode.
5. Place the **Sequencer** device in front and to the right of the MusicBlock Gallery (make sure the device’s volume is on the right). This way the music notes you need are not too far away.

   [![Place the Sequencer device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a9e2fc84-6f4d-4cb1-b181-d62b430cd9b0?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a9e2fc84-6f4d-4cb1-b181-d62b430cd9b0?resizing_type=fit)

   If you use a Grid Island for your test island, you will need to place a resource piece or terrain piece from the **Gallery** tab, then place the Sequencer device on top of it. The Sequencer device will not allow you to place it without something underneath.
6. Place **music notes** from the **MusicBlock Gallery** inside the **Sequencer volume** to create a song.

   [![Music blocks placed inside the Sequencer trap device volumes](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/37876652-fed2-40ee-9f6f-6d9834c88a4e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/37876652-fed2-40ee-9f6f-6d9834c88a4e?resizing_type=fit)
7. Step onto the **Sequencer plate** to listen to your song as you place the music notes.
8. Point your phone at the Sequencer device and press **E** to open the Sequencer options.
9. Edit the Sequencer device options to the song you create inside the Sequencer volume. The song used in this example is [Für Elise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqFbtmEQbFU).

   [![Edit the Sequencer options](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5a576494-50d7-40f7-a071-2d13f483efd8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5a576494-50d7-40f7-a071-2d13f483efd8?resizing_type=fit)

   | Option | Value | Explanation |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Looping** | 2X | Set to loop the song twice. |
   | **Tempo(bpm)** | 99 | Slows the rhythm down to 99 beats per minute for the song. |
   | **Length** | 10 | Set the volume length to 10 to accommodate the music blocks that will go inside. |

### Placing the Player Spawn Pad Device

1. Place the **Player Spawn Pad** device.

   [![Place the Player Spawn Pad device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ab03e6b9-5314-4ae0-9493-3615584b6de8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ab03e6b9-5314-4ae0-9493-3615584b6de8?resizing_type=fit)

   There is no need to edit the options on the Player Spawn Pad because the default options will automatically spawn the player onto the spawn pad.

### Placing the Billiboard Device

1. Place the **Billboard** device beside the Sequencer device and in front of the Player Spawn Pad. When the player spawns on the pad, the first thing they see is your message.

   [![Place the Billboard device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/166a3618-0d2b-429c-bf7e-20cae272be52?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/166a3618-0d2b-429c-bf7e-20cae272be52?resizing_type=fit)
2. Edit the Billboard device options.

   | **Outline** | Light | Adding an outline makes the text easier to see. |
   | **Shadow** | Lower Right | Adding a shadow makes the text easier to see. |
   | **Background Color** | Blue | Adding color to the background makes the text easier to read. |

3. Change the **My Island Settings** option for **Environmental Damage** to **Off**.

## Conclusion

The Mix Tape device gameplay example shows you how players can interact with the Sequencer device to play music or set off a chain reaction. This gameplay example can be as complicated or simple as you want.

You can set the music to play automatically in the level by connecting the Player Spawn Pad and the Sequencer device to a Trigger device. You can also add more than one Sequencer device to play all the registers of a song or to add layers to the song you create.
