**Replays** is a tool that packs a lot of potential when it comes to your social media game. You call the shots (literally!) when you use Replays in your games.

Whether you're a content creator, an island creator, or a player who wants to boost your gameplay by studying your own games, Replays is the way to get an immersive view of games you've played.

## Why Use Replays?

You can use Replays for:

- Studying gameplay from a recorded game.
- Debugging [game mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics) by watching a play session and seeing how things work.
- Making content to demonstrate things like [speed builds](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#speed-build) or other in-game activities.
- Showing a specific game mechanics or other island features to collaborators.
- Setting up specific shots and sequences for promotional trailers.
- Taking still shots (screen captures) of an island.
- Live streaming with footage you can control or edit.

**Replays does not make videos.** It makes a replay of a game that can be studied, shared with other Fortnite players, or captured using screen-recording software.
What it also does is provide a way to view and control the saved gameplay, look at the game from various angles and perspectives (including from the viewpoints of different players or teams), and set up specific shots or video clips.

## Setting Up Fortnite to Use Replays

Make sure your settings are as high as your device can handle before making a replay. This will help you capture the best images and videos possible. There are two places you'll modify settings:

- **Fortnite Game settings** — These settings affect every Fortnite game or experience you access.
- **My Island settings (optional)** — The settings you change here only affect the Creative island you're currently on.

For best results, apply the settings below before making your replay.

### Game Settings

1. From the **Fortnite lobby**, the **Creative hub**, or a **Creative island**, press the **Esc** key, click the **Settings (gear) icon**, then select **Settings** to open the [Game menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).
2. On the **VIDEO** tab, under **DISPLAY**, set the **WINDOW MODE** to **FULLSCREEN**. This adjusts the resolution to the maximum your screen supports. Your game will run slightly faster, but it will be harder for you to interact with other applications.
3. Go down to **GRAPHICS QUALITY**, and set **QUALITY PRESETS** to **EPIC**. This automatically sets the other features under Graphics Quality to best possible settings based on what your hardware supports.
4. You can leave other settings on default. Click **APPLY** to save these settings.

   [![Fullscreen and Epic quality presets make for a better image.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a75f86b4-32b1-4356-a03d-85a54b944b69?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a75f86b4-32b1-4356-a03d-85a54b944b69?resizing_type=fit)

   To restore the default values, click the **RESET** button at the bottom right of the screen.
   Before you exit, click the **APPLY** button to save your settings.
5. Select the **GAME** tab, and scroll all the way down to the **REPLAYS** settings group.
6. Make sure **RECORD REPLAYS** is set to **ON**, and set **RECORD CREATIVE MODE REPLAYS** to **ON**.
7. Save your changes.

   [![To record gameplay on a creative island, you need to set RECORD CREATIVE REPLAYS to ON.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/924aad1b-b2d6-4a6e-a976-323025be294d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/924aad1b-b2d6-4a6e-a976-323025be294d?resizing_type=fit)
8. (Optional) Go to the **AUDIO** tab, and adjust the **MUSIC** volume to **0** so the lobby music doesn't interrupt your video capture. Save this change.

   [![Audio Volume Settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d9aa2007-4700-4b5d-b55f-b5828c001cd4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/d9aa2007-4700-4b5d-b55f-b5828c001cd4?resizing_type=fit)

### My Island Settings

If you don't want [HUD messages](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) showing in your video, you'll need to do this final setup step. If you want to include HUD messages, skip it.

While the changes on the Game menu apply to all the islands you access in **Fortnite**, **My Island** settings affect only the island you're currently on.

1. Go to the island where you want to make a replay.
2. Press the **Tab** key, then select **My Island**.
3. Select the **UI** tab.

   [![Turn off the HUD info type to leave it out of your replay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a48082cb-d537-4a72-b56b-163c1e97ff40?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a48082cb-d537-4a72-b56b-163c1e97ff40?resizing_type=fit)
4. Set **HUD INFO TYPE** to **NONE**.

Save your changes when prompted.

## Using Replays

With Replays, you can access a replay of a game in 3D, change cameras and camera angles, zoom in or out, follow a specific player or team, and more.

Use Replays to stage shots or video clips as though you were there, holding the camera. And virtually speaking, you are!

### Access Replays

From the [lobby](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#lobby), click the [CAREER tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#career-tab) at the top of the screen, then the REPLAYS button near the bottom. This will open a list of captures from your recent gameplay.

[![Your list of replays, both saved and unsaved.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ed9b06ce-0794-48f0-a6d2-e972c436e67e?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ed9b06ce-0794-48f0-a6d2-e972c436e67e?resizing_type=fit)

Select a replay by clicking it, then:

- **PLAY** the selected replay
- **DELETE** it (this removes it from your local hard drive)
- **RENAME AND SAVE** it to your local drive (unsaved replays are called exactly that)
- **OPEN REPLAY FOLDER** to see where the file is stored on your local drive.

Click the **REFRESH** button to update the screen contents.

**VIEW STREAMING REPLAY** is a way to watch a live game using Replays, but you'll need the Session ID for the game. You'll find a string of numbers and letters to the right of your name in a game. That's the Session ID.

### Play Back a Replay

When you click **PLAY**, the replay video will open and start to play. Note that it always starts from the lobby because the replay is a recording of the entire experience.

Use the video progress bar to quickly scrub through the replay.

[![Use the progress bar to scrub through your replay.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b926625e-d6e2-4cf3-a722-68f91f9c3410?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b926625e-d6e2-4cf3-a722-68f91f9c3410?resizing_type=fit)

### Change Camera View

You can change the camera view in Replays.

[![Pick a different camera.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/608c8d5f-0c60-4125-abf8-3829ebb9ef6c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/608c8d5f-0c60-4125-abf8-3829ebb9ef6c?resizing_type=fit)

| Camera view | What It Does |
| --- | --- |
| **Third Person** | The default view, this follows a selected player through the game. |
| **Drone Follow** | A drone camera follows a player throughout the game, but can focus on other things, not just your main player. |
| **Drone Attach** | This drone camera has more freedom of movement. |
| **Drone Free** | This drone camera operates independently of your players. |
| **Gameplay** | Plays the replay from the POV of the camera attached to the selected player. Unlike Third Person, you cannot control the camera at all: it strictly follows the player's original camera movement. |

### Change Camera Settings

When you click the **camera settings toggle** in the controls, this opens the **camera settings panel**.

The first tab is for **focus and exposure**.

[![This tab is for focus and exposure.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2e93f89a-d45d-4939-90a2-a6fa55f862b5?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2e93f89a-d45d-4939-90a2-a6fa55f862b5?resizing_type=fit)

The settings above apply to all cameras except **Gameplay**, where these focus and exposure cannot be changed.

An important setting is [Aperture](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#aperture). This determines how much of an image is in focus.

![Higher aperture keeps more in focus.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/be05f059-efc3-4490-9880-9865c80eb20f?resizing_type=fit&width=1920&height=1080)

![A lower aperture blurs the background.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2dd824c4-2776-48b5-8ccb-c072debcf875?resizing_type=fit&width=1920&height=1080)

Higher aperture keeps more in focus.

A lower aperture blurs the background.

The next tab is for **effects**.

[![Video settings can be adjusted for higher or lower quality.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/41d9f01c-4aeb-42cf-9d68-2536687c3c3c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/41d9f01c-4aeb-42cf-9d68-2536687c3c3c?resizing_type=fit)

Some cameras have slightly different settings, but an important setting that's present for all cameras is **High Quality FX**. For best results, set this to **On** for any camera you use.

The final tab is for **game info**.

[![Select to display more info.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1b539279-47ec-4d5f-8328-61cd90b3d760?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/1b539279-47ec-4d5f-8328-61cd90b3d760?resizing_type=fit)

Changing the **Name Plates** option to **On** expands more setting options.

[![Setting Name Plates to On expands the fields.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a4ccb3ff-7170-48b7-92cd-1c2e5d6006c6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/a4ccb3ff-7170-48b7-92cd-1c2e5d6006c6?resizing_type=fit)

[![Set the time of day to control lighting.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c5b2716d-0ef3-437a-8668-ba2e28c60f69?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c5b2716d-0ef3-437a-8668-ba2e28c60f69?resizing_type=fit)

Want to control the lighting? Select the time of day, then set it to pause there.

## Using Replays for Screenshots or Videos

In Replays, when you find a moment in your gameplay that you want to capture, you can prepare the shot, then record it using screen capture or screen recording software.

## Leaving Replays

To exit Replays, press **Esc**, then click the **exit arrow** at the bottom left of the screen.

Also see [Making Videos in Fortnite](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-thumbnails-and-videos-in-fortnite-creative) and [Creating Thumbnails and Screenshots](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island).

## Why do my Replays Become Invalid?

Replays become unusable because the context changes too much. The Replay technology saves a simulated network stream, as if you were spectating live gameplay. For example, a replay from one season might show a flat area, but the next season, it becomes a jungle biome. Playing the Replay in the new context doesn't make sense.

The ever-evolving gameplay features present similar challenges. The data layouts may no longer match as features, code, and content evolve. Building backward compatibility to overcome these challenges isn't feasible. What this means is that if you want to capture still images or videos from a replay, you need to do it before a chapter or season updates.
