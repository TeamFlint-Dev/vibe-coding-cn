The **Community** category provides ways to connect up with other members of the **Fortnite Creative** community, and access information that makes it easier to design and build your own island in Fortnite.

To access the community features, go to **Island Settings**, then click **Community**.

This category provides a roadmap to areas of interest for both new and experienced creators.

[![Community category on Island Settings.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/788d0447-4377-4e26-ab3c-acb10fdaaf13?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/788d0447-4377-4e26-ab3c-acb10fdaaf13?resizing_type=fit)

This tab **does not** have a **Restore Defaults** button like most of the Island Settings categories. This is because there are no settings that you can change, only links that take you to other sources of information.

## Community Resources

You can access four different resources from this tab:

- [Getting Started in Fortnite Creative](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/community-in-fortnite-creative)
