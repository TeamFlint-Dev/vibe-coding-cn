1. From [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), press the **Tab** key, then click **CREATIVE** on the [top navigation bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to select the [CREATIVE inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen if not already displayed.
2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.
3. Scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then click either **Equip** or **Add To Chest**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). When you're back in Create mode, you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#equip) by pressing the **F** key. You can select equipped items by scrolling your middle mouse button or by pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard.

From the [Chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or a [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama) for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).

Chests and llamas are a great way to offer item bundles to players. Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the [Chest tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Each time you click **Add To Chest**, the item count will increase by one, shown as a yellow box on the Chest tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the Chest tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** button will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the Chest tab.

There are many ways for you to offer these items to players. Use any of the devices under the [Registering Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-egg-items-in-fortnite-creative#registering-items) section to offer or require these items during gameplay.

## Managing Items

[![Egg Loadout Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cb045f18-1bff-4ef0-b4ca-8ead22738cc6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/cb045f18-1bff-4ef0-b4ca-8ead22738cc6?resizing_type=fit)

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. Here, you can swap item positions or drop them from your Equipment bar.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Using Egg Items

Use these items to replenish damaged health and shield. It takes half a second to consume these items.

|  | Item | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Heal Egg](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4be39196-53cd-41d2-8e8e-488cce085cdd?resizing_type=fit) | **Heal Egg** | Instantly restores 10 points of health and then 1 point of health and shield for 20 seconds. Players carry up to six of this item in a stack.  [Heal Egg](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/60dd327e-61b2-49eb-a62f-327979a2059c?resizing_type=fit) |
| [Hop Egg](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/107c738e-5980-4ac6-a73d-d1bbba59cf0d?resizing_type=fit) | **Hop Egg** | Similar to the [**Hop Drop**](using-halloween-candy-items-in-fortnite-creative), the Hop Egg instantly recovers 10 points of health and shield as it applies a low gravity effect, causing the consuming player to jump at a higher distance. Players carry up to six of this item in a stack.  [Hop Egg](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2e32fb20-665c-4df7-95d7-7a1c776d37c4?resizing_type=fit) |

[![Registered Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e2b715ef-42cb-4596-ad75-7a182ee61c93?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e2b715ef-42cb-4596-ad75-7a182ee61c93?resizing_type=fit)

You can drop items directly onto devices that can either hold or [grant](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grant) items. You must [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) these items to save in the device's memory.

[![Registering Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93c611eb-cdd7-4ecf-853a-b9c374249f01?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/93c611eb-cdd7-4ecf-853a-b9c374249f01?resizing_type=fit)

*To register items to a device, stand directly on or immediately beside the device.*

To register an item for this kind of device, follow these steps. You can also watch a [video tutorial](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/RegisteringCraftingConsumablesinFortniteCreative/1_zpmj3v0g) that shows you how to register items, both crafting and usable.

1. In the CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY** inventory screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item. Compatible devices that can hold items include:

- **Vending Machine**
- **Team Settings & Inventory**
- **Class Designer**
- **Capture Item Spawner**
- **Capture Area**
- **Item Granter**
- **Item Spawner**
- **Conditional Button**
- **Elimination Manager**
- **Item Remover**

Use these devices to set up your own system for granting and spawning items onto your island.

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange items for another.

To do so, you can choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **[Stink Sacs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Hop Eggs](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/using-egg-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft **Stink Bombs**.
