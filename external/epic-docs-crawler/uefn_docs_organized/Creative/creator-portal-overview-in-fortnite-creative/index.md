The Creator Portal is the only way you can publish islands and control your Creator page and presence in the Fortnite ecosystem.

To get your own Creator Portal, first [join the **Island Creator Program**](https://create.fortnite.com/enroll), then get creative! Through the Island Creator Program, you’ll receive metrics on island performance and players, as well as payment for player engagement on published islands.

New features are added periodically to help creators like you create premium experiences, reach millions of potential players, and collaborate with other creators and teammates.
