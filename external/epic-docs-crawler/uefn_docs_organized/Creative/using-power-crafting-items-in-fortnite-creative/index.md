Use Power [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) as a necessary ingredient to craft items that may need one of these types of energy sources. These items can be required as the energy ingredient for items like, **Ray Gun**, **Flashlight**, or **Jetpack**.

These items could be exchanged for a usable item either singularly or with another to unlock requirements for devices like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

You could pair **Blast Powder** with **[Rough Ore](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-mineral-powder-items-in-fortnite-creative#mineral-powder-items)** as ingredients needed to craft weapons or usable items like **Dynamite**.

Power items are:

- **Active Powercell**
- **Batteries**
- **Blast Powder**

You can also blend items with [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) of similar [themes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Grant crafting items with a pair of devices like **Button** and **Item Granter** to blend them with similar props from the **Galleries** tab. For example, you can blend Active Powercells with generator-themed props to fully immerse players onto your island.

To create the process of crafting, you will need to either [spawn](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#spawning) or [grant](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#grant) items onto the map for players to collect with the [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) or [**Item Granter**](using-item-granter-devices-in-fortnite-creative).

The players can collect these items to exchange for usable items through the Conditional Button. They can also use these items to craft other items that will build up to a larger piece or a usable item.

## Finding and Placing Items

[![Finding Power Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aa9c36f1-18f4-4c8f-873e-363d9dac5520?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/aa9c36f1-18f4-4c8f-873e-363d9dac5520?resizing_type=fit)

1. From [Build mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), press the **Tab** key, then click **CREATIVE** on the top navigation bar to select the CREATIVE inventory screen if not already displayed.
2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.
3. On this screen, scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then click either **EQUIP** or **ADD TO CHEST**.

Clicking EQUIP will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resources-bar). (When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**).

You may want to offer an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or a [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting ADD TO CHEST will add the item to the [CHEST tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Each time you click it, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the CHEST tab .

You can add up to fifteen items to the CHEST tab. When it’s full, the ADD TO CHEST tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the CHEST tab.

From the CHEST tab, you can select either CREATE CHEST or CREATE LLAMA to store the items in a chest or a llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama).

## Managing Items

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the **PLAY** inventory, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from your Equipment bar.

[![Power Resources Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ec865ee4-ef32-412b-9e77-72345709130c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ec865ee4-ef32-412b-9e77-72345709130c?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's better to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Registering Crafting Items to a Device

Some devices can hold or grant items. To [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) an item for this kind of device, follow these steps.

1. In the CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY** inventory screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item.
