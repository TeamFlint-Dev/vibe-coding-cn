## Lesson Overview

Do your students love Fortnite? How would they like to put their passion to work as they develop a variety of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and math) skills? This lesson plan is designed to do just that by guiding Fortnite players through the building process to create one of the Wonders of the World in Fortnite Creative. Students can work in groups or individually to create their Wonder.

For inspiration, students can explore some of the Wonders of the World that have been built by their favorite creators on YouTube!

Fortnite Creative’s powerful tools allow builders to construct almost any structure, terrain, or environment. By building a Wonder of the World, students will learn about its history, size, location, and purpose. In addition, they will establish the original appearance of their Wonder and compare it with its current look. To accomplish these tasks, students will find photos, graphics, dimensions and floor plans, then translate that information to a scale replica for Fortnite avatars to explore.

We have determined that the following Wonders of the World are the most educational and best suited for Fortnite Creative Island's capabilities.

1. One of the three Great Pyramids of Egypt. The Pyramid of Menkaure is ideal, due to its manageable size.
2. A section of The Great Wall of China. We recommend the section of extremely steep slopes in Jinshanling.
3. Chichén Itzá's El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan)
4. Machu Picchu (part or all)
5. The Colosseum
6. Stonehenge
7. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
8. The Temple of Artemis

## Desired Results

What are the learning outcomes for students?

### ESSENTIAL QUESTIONS/BIG IDEAS

What is the significance of the Wonders of the World?

- Which materials were available at the time of construction, and how to simulate materials, objects, and plants in Fortnite.
- Construction practices of the builders, and the engineering techniques they used.
- The significance of the Wonders of the World.
- Details about the Wonder they create, as well as those created by their peers.

## Lesson Plan

### Hook

### INSTRUCTION / DISCUSSION

Discussion: What is a Wonder of the World? Allow students to do cursory research on the Wonders of the World and participate in a class discussion.

### EXPLORATION

There are different lists of the Wonders of the World available. Below are the Wonders with the best size and construction to build and play in Fortnite Creative.

Have students explore the Wonders of the World and choose one to recreate in Fortnite Creative:

- [The Pyramid of Menkaure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Menkaure#Temple_complex)
- Jinshanling slopes of [The Great Wall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China)
- Chichén Itzá's [El Castillo (Temple of Kukulcan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Castillo,_Chichen_Itza)
- All or part of [Machu Picchu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machu_Picchu)
- [The Colosseum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum)
- Interpretation of [The Hanging Gardens of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon)
- [The Temple of Artemis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Artemis)
- [Stonehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge)

Explore each Wonder in class and for homework. Students choose one Wonder and gather the following information:

- When, where, why, and by whom was your Wonder built?
- What does your Wonder look like now, and what did it look like when it was first built?
- Establish your Wonder of the World's rough dimensions.
- Find any floor plans, photos, schematics, etc. available and record them.
- Establish the number of meters that make up a grid square in Fortnite.
- View the Wakelet resources, and use the information to recreate one of the Wonders of the World in Fortnite Creative.

### ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS

1. Sketch the Wonder you have chosen and label it with the actual dimensions.
2. Start a new Fortnite Creative Island using the Grid Island Template.
3. Start the foundation of your Wonder of the World to the correct dimensions.
4. Share progress with a peer and recruit feedback.
5. Build each day and engage in “pair share,” in which you and a peer explore each other’s Wonders. After you explore, provide verbal feedback to each other.

The completed project will be a walkthrough that provides information about the Wonder and incorpo-rates game mechanics to create an immersive Fortnite Creative experience.

**Reminder: "Perfect is the enemy of done."**

## EXTENSION ACTIVITY

Students with extra time should further develop their Wonder to include game mechanics. Ideas could include:

- Wonder of the World Scavenger Hunt: Students incorporate objects for players to find in and around their Wonder of the World.
- Escape the Wonder! Students incorporate game mechanics that require players to find a key to open doors, avoid traps, and solve other puzzles in order to escape.

## CULMINATING ACTIVITY

- Record a screen capture of a narrated walkthrough of your Wonder of the World.
- Submit the walkthrough as a video.
- Post a short write-up to accompany your video walkthrough submission. The write-up should explain when, where, why, and by whom your Wonder was built.
- With permission from your teacher and parents, post a video of your creation publicly to help other students and teachers learn with Fortnite Creative Island.
