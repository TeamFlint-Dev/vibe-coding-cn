Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

Chests and llamas are a great way to offer item bundles to players. Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the **Chest** tab. Each time you click **Add To Chest**, the item count will increase by one, shown as a yellow box on the Chest tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab.

There are many ways for you to offer these items to players. Use the devices under the [Registering Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-travel-items-in-fortnite-creative#registering-items) section to either offer or require these items during gameplay.

| [Crash Pad](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c5ba02e3-7fbc-4cfa-a04a-6f31cba82ebf?resizing_type=fit) | **Crash Pad** | Like the [**Crash Pad**](using-crash-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device, players can bounce and launch themselves to a desired direction with no fall damage. Vehicles and projectiles like grenades and rockets will also bounce when touching this item. Crash Pads can be equipped in stacks of six and deflates after 60 seconds. |
| [Inflate-A-Bull](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9621ccae-585e-42a6-9aac-56d89007d579?resizing_type=fit) | **Inflate-A-Bull** | Players can traverse the map in an inflatable cow suit. This item is a deployable backpack that allows players to moo, bounce, and roll with speed. This item will permanently deflate after two minutes or temporarily when attacked. Can be equipped one item at a time.  [Cow Suit](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/78c1f18d-c3da-4d60-8cb2-27a0e6a5c1f8?resizing_type=fit) |
| [Balloon](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/83c56f17-042e-4f2b-bf9f-dba613d0c8c9?resizing_type=fit) | **Balloon** | Players can glide in various directions while jumping. This item is equipped in stacks of ten and can be individually detached when needed.  [Cow Suit](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c537e56c-5141-4d09-80cf-c8d6ba170453?resizing_type=fit) |
| [Gliders](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/4cc79f9b-3068-4972-9342-75a96510ec3f?resizing_type=fit) | **Gliders** | With the setting **Glider Redeploy** as **Off** in the **My Island - Settings** tab, players can use this item to glide when falling from high altitudes.

## Registering Items

[![Registered Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7ee1ea42-0535-455c-997d-d629621ae9ac?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/7ee1ea42-0535-455c-997d-d629621ae9ac?resizing_type=fit)

You can drop items directly onto devices that can either hold or grant items. You must [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) these items to save in the device's memory.

[![Registering Consumables](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c5eefa04-76cd-4f5f-9e8f-1864e31b3b7d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c5eefa04-76cd-4f5f-9e8f-1864e31b3b7d?resizing_type=fit)

To register items to a device, you must stand directly on or immediately beside the device.

To register an item for this kind of device, follow these steps. You can also watch a [video tutorial](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/RegisteringCraftingConsumablesinFortniteCreative/1_zpmj3v0g) that shows you how to register items, both crafting and usable.

1. In the CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY** inventory screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item. Compatible devices that can hold items include:

- **Vending Machine**
- **Team Settings & Inventory**
- **Class Designer**
- **Capture Item Spawner**
- **Item Granter**
- **Item Spawner**
- **Conditional Button**
- **Elimination Manager**
- **Item Remover**

Use these devices to set up your own system for granting and spawning items onto your island.

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and weapons to create the process of crafting, where players exchange items for another.

To do so, you can choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **Balloons** and **[Sturdy Mechanical Parts](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-mechanical-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft a **Jetpack**.
