We've seen how games can change classrooms and communities for the better, but can they really help *all* of humanity survive — and even thrive?

The United Nations has [**17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). These are must-reach targets for the year 2030, and have been crafted with the purpose of supporting continued comfortable human life on Earth.

At Epic, we've taken these goals to heart. We're providing lesson plans that you can use with Fortnite Creative to educate a new generation on the importance of sustainability across many aspects of life.

Our SDG lesson plans are listed below. Check back routinely as we add more!
