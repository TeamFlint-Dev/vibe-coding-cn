Through Fortnite, you can access **Battle Royale**, **Zero Build - Battle Royale**, and more games and experiences made by **Epic Games**. Many more are made by island creators and developers who don't work for Epic but take advantage of the free **Fortnite Creative** toolkit to build their own games.

And if you don't find the game you want to play, you too can build your own!

You can play Fortnite games on PC, Mac, and a range of consoles and mobile devices.

## Chapters and Seasons

Fortnite Battle Royale releases come in chapters, and each chapter is made up of seasons. A new season drops every two or three months, and brings with it a bunch of new outfits, vehicles, weapons, and other gameplay features to keep players, old and new, on their toes.

Each new season also comes with a video that introduces some of the cool new things you can expect.

Like the Fortnite seasons, the user interface (UI) also changes frequently, so don't be surprised if the images on this page don't match what you see on your screen!

## The Lobby

This is the Fortnite lobby, where the fun begins.

[![The new Fortnite lobby from November 2023.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0a2cdd6c-2c1e-4dee-841f-cf17b02cded1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0a2cdd6c-2c1e-4dee-841f-cf17b02cded1?resizing_type=fit)

From here, you can find friends, select from different products and game modes, or go to Fortnite Creative to make your own island.

### The Nav Bar

[![An example of the Fortnite lobby Navbar.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/54255578-d1ca-4837-b628-52d8a976a9b6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/54255578-d1ca-4837-b628-52d8a976a9b6?resizing_type=fit)

- **PLAY:** Click Play to return to the lobby.
- **LOCKER:** Where you keep your outfits and other cosmetics — anything that affects the appearance of your avatar. This is also where you go to change your outfit.
- **SHOP:** Feeling like having a makeover? Go shopping in the Item Shop! But make sure you bring your V-Bucks (an in-game currency you can use to purchase Battle Passes, cosmetics, and other cool stuff). And in case you were wondering, new items are offered with every new season.
- **BATTLEPASS:** The **Battle Pass** is a featured item in Battle Royale that players can use to unlock in-game cosmetics, V-Bucks, and other fun stuff. When you buy a Battle Pass for the current season, it also unlocks additional quests and challenges.
- **QUESTS:** A quest is a task or objective you can complete to gain a reward. The most common reward is experience points, or XP, that you can use to unlock more features in a game.
- **COMPETE:** Find out what competitions are happening, when, and their details. TL:DR: Fortnite Champion Series, or FNCS, is a high-profile Fortnite esports competition.
- **CAREER:** Want to know how your game scores compare to your friends' scores? Click Profile. Want to study a game you played, or a game someone else shared a replay of? Click Replays.
- **V-BUCKS:**You can purchase V-Bucks here!

### Select a Game

The lobby is where you select a game then press **PLAY!** to start that game.

[![The play button starts the selected game mode.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/da542ba9-28a0-451f-8f37-5014c35c8efe?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/da542ba9-28a0-451f-8f37-5014c35c8efe?resizing_type=fit)

Some games provide options for the number of players, ranging from solo to squads (usually teams of four).

If you have this option, you can change your team size before you click **Play**.

If you don't have enough friends to fill your team, random teammates will be added, so don't worry if you have an odd number of friends who want to play, or if you want to play on a squad but are playing by yourself.

If you don’t want to play a game from Creative with random people, select the **Private Game** option above the play button.

[![Select Private to stop strangers from joining your game.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b5bc2e46-be8d-44c4-8c84-d3f5ab7a3825?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/b5bc2e46-be8d-44c4-8c84-d3f5ab7a3825?resizing_type=fit)

To start a game quickly or enter ranked competition, select the **No Fill** and **Ranked** options when selecting a **mode**. No Fill assigns bots to the lobby so you don’t have to wait for more people to join the game.

Take a second to click the **Emote** button (because you can, and because it's fun!) then click **Play**!

[![Learn new tips and tricks while waiting for your game to load.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/af50b2a5-89b3-4fbe-afdf-4194d5d3abf4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/af50b2a5-89b3-4fbe-afdf-4194d5d3abf4?resizing_type=fit)

You can pick up some great tips at the bottom of the screen while Creative is loading.

### The Hub

When Creative finishes loading, you'll be in the hub.

Find your golden rift, and approach it until you're close enough to activate your console.

[![use the console in fortnite](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/abf52dd2-ee8a-4ad9-8ca6-98f86f2a92ae?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/abf52dd2-ee8a-4ad9-8ca6-98f86f2a92ae?resizing_type=fit)

Access your console, and you're ready to start building an island!

And remember to emote!
