You can manage traps in the player inventory. To access the player inventory, press **Tab** while you have your pickaxe equipped. Here, you can swap item positions or drop them from your Equipment bar.

You cannot reposition or copy trap items with the phone tool. To delete a trap item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either **Respawn** or **Back To Hub** from the **Sidebar**. Doing this will clear your inventory.
