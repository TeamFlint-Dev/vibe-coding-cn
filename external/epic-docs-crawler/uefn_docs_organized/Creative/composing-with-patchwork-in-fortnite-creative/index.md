**Fortnite Patchwork** is a suite of devices for Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) that you can use to create and manipulate music and visuals to sync with your gameplay.

With Patchwork, you can:

- **Make musical gameplay**: Embed music and player interaction or manipulation of music into game loops to create musical gameplay experiences.
- **Create an adaptive soundtrack**: Use the devices to produce a soundtrack that's both unique to your island and fully integrated into the game world, so it can respond and evolve as a result of a player's interactions and the game's state.
- **Let players make music**: Enable players to interact with the devices directly to create music and even perform using the devices.

To get started, check out:

- **Patchwork Music Gallery (5806-7083-7937)**: a Fortnite island with a hands-on walkthrough of the Patchwork system.
- **Getting Started with Patchwork**: a tutorial that explains how to use Patchwork and is a companion to the Music Gallery.
- **Club Patchwork (6730-0905-0185)**: hop into the club and jam with some friends on this island!
- **Yacht Heist Template Island**: a template island in the Creative toolset that showcases how to create an adaptive soundtrack as resources change and the game progresses.
- **Patchwork x Yacht Heist Tutorial**: a companion tutorial that shows you how to build the heist and setup the Patchwork devices in more detail.

But the best way to learn Patchwork is to jump in, alone or with some friends, and start jamming! So what are you waiting for? **Go make stuff!**

Please be reminded that use of a Patchwork audio device is limited to the creation of new and original musical works. Use of an audio device to re-create copyrighted musical compositions owned by third parties is a violation of Epic's terms and may result in your island being unpublished.
