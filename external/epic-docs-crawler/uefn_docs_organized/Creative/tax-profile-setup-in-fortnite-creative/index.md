Your tax profile is the information Epic Games is required to collect to fulfill tax withholding and reporting requirements.

You'll only reach the Tax Profile screen if you need to provide tax information, are of an eligible age for the program, and have demonstrated that you qualify to join the selected program.

If you have already successfully set up a tax profile with Epic Games, you should not have to do it again.

## Consents Screen

[Tax Identity](http://www.taxidentity.com/) is an external company that handles all tax documents on behalf of Epic. It uses your **Social Security number**, **national ID number**, or **Tax ID** to confirm your identity and comply with applicable tax reporting obligations.

You'll fill out the necessary forms based on your country of residence, and Tax Identity will retain your tax information.

1. Click **Yes** to consent to providing an electronic signature.
2. Click **Yes** to **I consent to electronic receipt of my information reporting documentation** to receive your year-end forms by email, or **No** to have the forms mailed to you.

## New Tax Record Screen

1. When prompted, click **CREATE TAX PROFILE** to open a dialog.
2. Click **CREATE TAX PROFILE** again and the **New Tax Record** dialog opens.
3. Select the type of tax profile you want to create.

   **If you have any questions about which option to select, consult with a tax professional.**
4. Select one of these options:

   - **PERSONAL:** This is for an individual. For this, you will need your personal Social Security Number (SSN), or the equivalent number for tax reporting in your country of residence.
   - **SOLE PROPRIETOR:** If you have an unincorporated business that you own and operate alone, and want any funds to go to the business.
   - **SINGLE MEMBER LLC:** LLC stands for Limited Liability Company, and is only available in the US. To set up this tax information, you must have already set up your LLC, and you must be the only owner/partner in the company.
   - **BUSINESS:** This is the option to use if you have a business with one or more partners. If you select BUSINESS, you will also be asked for your business email before the tax wizard opens.
5. Click **CONTINUE**.

## Start Tax Interview

The information you enter below should be for the individual actively participating in the program.

If you are completing this form on behalf of a company or organization, your information will be collected separately.

1. Read the instructions carefully, then click **Continue**.
2. Fill out all of the required information. The questions will be based on the tax profile type you select and your country of residence.

   Click the **Help** button at any time if there is something you don't understand, and more information will be provided. Also, if you enter incorrect information and can't change it, click **Exit**, then restart the interview. Exiting the interview before completing and saving will erase all the information and give you a fresh start.
3. When you get to the end of the form and have submitted it, click **Exit Interview** to return to the website.

Verification can take up to five business days, depending on your country of residence. Epic will send you an email when your tax information is verified, with a link to take you back to where you left off in your enrollment.
