Before you can market an island, you need to [publish](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) it. During the publishing process, you'll get an [island code](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#island-code) you can use to send players to your island.

## Marketing with Fortnite's Help

Once you have the code (or URL) for your published island, give it to people you know.

With this code, your friends and followers can find your island in [Discover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

If your island is getting a lot of play, Epic might notice,and expand on that by featuring your island.

## Marketing with Social Media

Want to reach further than your immediate circle of friends? Social media is a great way to introduce your island experience to the world by showing off what you've done with [videos](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-thumbnails-and-videos-in-fortnite-creative) or [screenshots](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/promoting-your-fortnite-creative-island), or in conversations in the many fan communities where you'll find like-minded gamers for every [game mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mode) you can imagine — or build.

### Video and Streaming

A couple of ways to use video trailers and live streaming are:

- **YouTube:** Set up your own YouTube channel then show off your work in videos you post there.
- **Twitch:** Same goes for making a Twitch channel. Demonstrate your islands in live streams!

People are also going to be interested in the process of how you create your island, so you could do a series of videos that show how you built it. You can also make a tutorial with detailed steps, from start to finish. And then once the game is complete, follow up with a video that shows how much fun it can be to play!

If you have friends who are also island creators, invite them to play your game with you while you stream or record, then share the recordings with them for their own channels.

### Social Media Posts

Social media like Twitter and Instagram (and any other social platforms you use) are great ways to get people to notice your work:

- Use short videos on YouTube, Instagram or TikTok to showcase live events, or show off secret and hidden items on your island.
- Share intriguing screenshots of your island to generate interest.
- Share the URL or code for your island in all of your social bios.
- Share links to your YouTube or Twitch channel to encourage people to watch your streams and videos.
- Network with other Fortnite players and other Fortnite island creators and set up cross-promotions with them.

### Discord and Other Communities

Many content creators on social media and other platforms use Discord servers to create a place where their fans and supporters can hang out together and talk about the stuff they love. You may also belong to communities on Reddit or other platforms. Here are some ways you can network and let your peers know what you are doing in Fortnite Creative.

Most Discord servers and other communities like Reddit have specific rules about where, when, and how often you can post information about things you have made (this is often called "self-promotion"). Make sure you follow the rules of the community before repeatedly posting about your islands!

- **Join the Fortnite Creative Discord!** You can make friends and network with other content creators, discuss the creation process, brainstorm ideas for how to solve design problems, even share your creations!
- **Are you part of Discord servers or other communities where people talk about Fortnite, or about creating mods and levels in other games?** You can talk about what you are making in Fortnite, and post the URL or code for your island (if the community allows).
- **Create your own Discord server!** This is especially helpful if you are already creating content on YouTube or Twitch, and have an established social media presence. Creating your own community on Discord is a great way to let people know more about what you are making.
