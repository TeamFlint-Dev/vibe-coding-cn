### Placing the Random Number Generator Device

Only modify the options described below, leave the rest of the default settings as is.

1. Press **Tab** to go into the **Creative Inventory**.
2. Click **Devices > Random Number Generator (RNG) > Equip** to add the Random Number Generator device to your **Quick Bar**. Continue to add the following devices from the menu:

   1. Player Spawn Pad device
   2. Sentry device
   3. Class Selector device
   4. Class Designer device
   5. Score Manager device
   6. Timed Objective device
   7. Trigger device
3. Place the RNG outside the arena. Make sure that the volume boxes of the device don’t go into the arena area.

   If the RNG volume boxes stray into the arena, copy the device and turn it around by pressing **E** to rotate the device out of the arena. Paste the RNG outside the arena, then delete the RNG you copied.

4. Edit the RNG device options.

   [![Editing the Random Number Generator device options](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/08992003-a85c-4717-9f62-92945de9ef27?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/08992003-a85c-4717-9f62-92945de9ef27?resizing_type=fit)

   | Option | Value | Explanation |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Winning Value** | **3** | Determines the winning value that awards the shield and legendary assault rifle to the player. |
   | **Zone** | **Forward** | Set to move forward through the zone associated with the Trigger devices in the RNG volume boxes. |
   | **Activate When Receiving From** | **Channel 10** | Receives a signal from the Trigger device and randomly selects from volumes 1-6. |
   | **On Win Transmit On** | **Channel 9** | Sends a signal to the second Class Selector device to grant the player the Legendary Assault rifle and shield. |
   | **On Lose Transmit** | **Channel 8** | Sends a signal to the first Class Selector to grant the player a Rare Sidearm pistol. |
   | **When Rolled Max Transmit On** | **Channel 6** | When the number specified by Value Limit 2 is rolled, a signal is sent to the Score Manager to award Points to the player. |

   The default values for **Value Limit 1** (1) and **Value Limit 2** (6) are the values you want to work with, these volumes determine how many volume boxes to add to the RNG.
   The RNG counts as a sequencer, the Trigger devices in the volume boxes activate all devices set to accept sequencers when triggered by the RNG.

### Placing the Player Spawn Pad Device

1. Select the **Player Spawn Pad** device from the Quick Bar.

   [![Placing the Player Spawn Pad device](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bda45ffc-0a6a-4749-b7b5-8262ddeaf4b6?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/bda45ffc-0a6a-4749-b7b5-8262ddeaf4b6?resizing_type=fit)

### Placing the Timed Objective Device

1. Select the **Timed Objective** device from the Quick Bar.

   [![Placing the Timer device outside the arena](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ef9c3441-655c-4573-8044-8a1f3ed1a06d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/ef9c3441-655c-4573-8044-8a1f3ed1a06d?resizing_type=fit)
2. Edit the Timed Objective device options.

   | Option | Value | Explanation |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Time** | **2 Seconds** | Creates a short delay between the Random Number Generator, Score Manager, and Sentry devices. |
   | **Countdown Visible on HUD** | **No** | There’s no need to clutter the HUD with timer info since it’s only 2 seconds. |
   | **Completion Behavior** | **Reset** | Allows the device to be re-used each time it's triggered by a signal. |
   | **Urgency Mode Start Time** | **2** | The player will hear the ticking of the timer. |
   | **Audio Effects** | **Off** | This device is primarily used for the channel functions and doesn’t need to have all its sounds audible. |
   | **Timer Sound Distance** | **Whole Map** | Players will hear an audio cue that a sentry will spawn soon. |
   | **Start When Receiving From** | **Channel 7** | Sets the delay before transmitting to the RNG Device. |
   | **When Complete Transmit On** | **Channel 10** | Signals the RNG to start randomly selecting a volume box number between 1-6. |

   The delay acts as a buffer between spawns since feeding directly into the RNG device can cause problems.

## Playing Your Game

From playing with this example, you’ll understand how to use the Score Manager to award points when triggered, how the RNG works with the Triggers and the Timed Objective device to randomly spawn Sentries, and how to create different player classes and parameters for each class.

Create your own version of the Random Sentry Fight by substituting sentries for creatures or animals. Try editing the radius for each of your sentries so they spawn at different distances between the player and the spawn point and change the points awarded based on the sentry’s level of difficulty.
