**Attack** [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) can cause damage and eliminate enemy players when thrown. Offer these items when you want to give players unique and fun ways to battle each other.

Attack items include:

- **Cuddle Fish**
- **Storm Flip**
- **Junk Rift**
- **Air Strike**

You can find attack items in the Content tab of the menu screen, in the **Items** category. In the right side bar, you can sort by the type of item.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). When you're back in Create mode, you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) by pressing the **F** key. You can select equipped items by either scrolling your middle mouse button or by pressing its corresponding number on your keyboard.

From the [Chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or a [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

Chests and llamas are a great way to offer item bundles to players. Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the **Chest** tab. Each time you click **Add To Chest**, the item count will increase by one, shown as a yellow box on the Chest tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the Chest tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** button will disappear. You first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab to add more.

There are many ways to offer these items to players. Use any devices under the [Registering Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-attack-items-in-fortnite-creative#registering-items) section to offer or require these items during gameplay.

## Managing Items

[![Attack Loadout Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2f3c038e-8c66-4cb6-9e24-ff0b00f6c342?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2f3c038e-8c66-4cb6-9e24-ff0b00f6c342?resizing_type=fit)

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. Here, you can swap item positions or drop them from your Equipment bar.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either **Respawn** or **Back To Hub** from the Game Menu (Sidebar). When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Using Attack Items

While in **Create** mode, these items can be used by holding the right mouse button. Use the [aiming arc](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to position and throw the item at your target.

*To register items to a device, stand directly on or immediately beside the device.*

To register an item for this kind of device, follow the steps below. (You can also watch a [video tutorial](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/RegisteringCraftingConsumablesinFortniteCreative/1_zpmj3v0g) that shows you how to register items, for [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) or other [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) use.)

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), where players exchange one item or group of items for another.

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the **[Conditional Button](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/conditional-button)** and [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **[Planks](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-primal-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Blast Powder](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-power-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft a **Junk Rift**.
