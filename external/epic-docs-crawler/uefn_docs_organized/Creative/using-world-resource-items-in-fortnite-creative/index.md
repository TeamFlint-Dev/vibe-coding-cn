You can use **world resource** [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) as building materials or as currency for devices like the Conditional Button.

World Resource items are:

- **Wood**
- **Brick**
- **Stone**

While [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game), you can offer these resources throughout the world for players to gather by using devices like the **Item Spawner** or **Item Granter**.

Through the [My Island - Settings menu](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary), you can adjust multiple settings that can alter resource allocations for your island. You can also change settings like **Infinite Resources** to determine whether resouces will be unlimited or not.

These world resources can be used as building materials for game modes like Zone Wars.

You could also require these resources as a currency for devices like the Item Spawner and [Vending Machine](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#vending-machine). The set requirements will show on a HUD message near the device.

## Finding and Placing World Resource Items

1. From [Build mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), press the **Tab** key, then click **CREATIVE** on the [top navigation bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to select the [CREATIVE inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen if not already displayed.
2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.
3. On this screen, scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then click either **EQUIP** or **ADD TO CHEST**.

Clicking EQUIP will add the item to your [Resources bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#resources-bar). (When you're back in Create mode, you can view items in your Resources bar by pressing the **Tab** key and selecting **Play**)

You may want to offer an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting ADD TO CHEST will add the item to the [CHEST tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

Each time you click ADD TO CHEST, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the CHEST tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the CHEST tab. When it’s full, the ADD TO CHEST tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the CHEST tab.

## Managing Items

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the **Play** inventory screen, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from the Resources bar.

[![Play Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2aabc9fa-b138-404d-acbf-3982168f07e2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/2aabc9fa-b138-404d-acbf-3982168f07e2?resizing_type=fit)

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Registering Items

Some devices can hold or grant items. To [register](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#register) an item for this kind of device, follow these steps.

1. In CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY inventory** screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item.
