Our hero hears the ambient sound of a chest coming from somewhere above, and starts running up the nearby staircase towards the sound. However, as they touch the bottom step, disaster strikes! Find a way to dodge the massive boulder in order to acquire the chest!

The object of Boulder Trap is to trigger a rolling ball that can eliminate players who are run over by the ball.

## Playing Your Game

The surprising nature of the Boulder Trap gives your players a little challenge and makes them work for their victory. The Boulder Trap can be placed inside any building with a staircase or in a hallway as long as the ball can clear the ceiling and doesn’t have objects obstructing its path.

You might find that some of the settings for the ball and the pinball flipper need to be adjusted to be less reactive or a smaller ball size depending where you place the trap. Consider that the pinball flipper cannot be hidden and can be hard for the player to jump over.

Get out there and create some Boulder Traps, and learn how these devices and traps interact!
