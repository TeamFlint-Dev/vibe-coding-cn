**Discover is your access to everything in Fortnite.**

Select the first tile in the [Homebar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/exploring-discover-in-fortnite-creative) or scroll up to view the lobby of the last island you accessed, or to see if any of your friends are active in Fortnite.

## The Homebar

The top row of tiles in Discover is called the **Homebar**.

[![I rode through Discover on the row with no name, it felt good to be back in the game...](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8cd7cc85-3f2f-426f-a5bb-565c7105a6d9?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8cd7cc85-3f2f-426f-a5bb-565c7105a6d9?resizing_type=fit)

This row has no title, but it shows your currently selected experience and other islands pulled from rows in Discover.

[Party cards](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#party-card) will show up on the Homebar, the Sidebar, or another row in Discover.

[![Find friends and ongoing games with party cards!](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/25946106-0504-41bc-ab3d-da3b200fa186?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/25946106-0504-41bc-ab3d-da3b200fa186?resizing_type=fit)

Party cards show your party invites, active parties, and requests to join.

## Game Categories

The rows under the Homebar are **categories**.

[![Category rows group islands together based on one or more commonalities.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6c5982f0-c7d8-4562-9033-776e89d45ec3?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6c5982f0-c7d8-4562-9033-776e89d45ec3?resizing_type=fit)

For example, the **Trending** row shows games that are currently getting a lot of play, and **By Epic** shows games that are made by Epic rather than creators. These categories change routinely.

To explore more categories, click the **Search icon** at the top of the screen and a list of categories will open.

## Island Ratings

When browsing published islands in Fortnite, players will see a rating on each island tile.The ratings that display depend on the player’s region. For example, players in North America will see ratings assigned by the ESRB (Entertainment Software Ratings Board).

After selecting an island in Discover, the player will see the island detail page, which shows the full, region-specific rating information for the island, including the rating category, descriptors, and interactive elements.

To learn more, see [Age Ratings are for Players and Parents](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative#ageratingsareforplayersandparents) and [Components of an Age Rating](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite-creative/iarc-overview-and-faqs-in-fortnite-creative#componentsofanagerating).

### Locked Islands in Discover

Players with parental controls enabled may see some islands in Discover displayed as locked, depending on the rating level set in their Fortnite parental controls. To learn more, see [Epic Parental Controls](https://safety.epicgames.com/en-US/parental-controls).

### Unlock an Island

Parents or guardians can unlock individual islands that are rated above the rating set for their child’s account.

When viewing an island detail page, a player will see full rating information for the island (which differs by player region), and a call to action to unlock the island.

Selecting the option to unlock prompts for the parental PIN.

After the PIN is entered, the island is unlocked and the player can play.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/566fb5ec-0005-4bd5-a1a4-e190f9cfa01d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/566fb5ec-0005-4bd5-a1a4-e190f9cfa01d?resizing_type=fit)

Unlocked islands remain unlocked for a player, except in two cases:

- **An island is re-rated to be more mature.** In the case that an island is re-rated to be more mature, all players for whom that island has been unlocked by their parent or guardian will lose access. The player may request access to the island again in the same manner as described above.
- **A parent or guardian removes access to an unlocked island.** A parent or guardian can manage access to previously unlocked islands for their child’s account in the Fortnite parental control settings.
