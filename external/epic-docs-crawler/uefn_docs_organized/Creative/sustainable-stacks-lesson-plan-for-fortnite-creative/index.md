  Lesson Overview

This challenge relates to [**Sustainable Development Goal 1: No Poverty**](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal1).

Welcome to a ground-breaking Fortnite creative lesson that bridges the virtual world with real-world impact!

Embark on a journey to tackle one of the most critical global challenges: poverty and the lack of affordable and sustainable housing. **Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1)** aims to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, ensuring that no one is left behind.

This lesson experience centers on creating a thriving and inclusive community, where students will build the Sustainable Stacks village on the Greasy Grove template Island.

In line with SDG 1 and its relevant targets, the mission is two-fold:

To provide a solution for affordable and sustainable housing to address the needs of the unhoused. By designing and constructing the Sustainable Stacks village, the aim is to create a safe and welcoming haven for those in need, fostering a sense of security and belonging.
The village will serve as accommodations for the diligent workers supporting the various businesses in the area. Through innovative design and the use of shipping container-styled dwellings, this project will demonstrate how cost-effective and eco-friendly solutions can reshape the way to approach housing and combat poverty.

As you embark on this creative endeavor, keep in mind the transformative power to make a tangible difference in the lives of others and leave a lasting mark on the path toward a more sustainable and equitable future.

Let the construction of the Sustainable Stacks begin!

In this lesson, students will build the Sustainable Stacks, an affordable and sustainable housing village made of containers, 3x1x1 or 4x1x1 in size.

They’ll use editing skills to create doors and windows while adding stairs, greenery, and other assets to make this a desirable community for the hard-working citizens of Greasy Grove.

### Rationale

In today's world, the challenge of affordable housing and the growing issue of homelessness have reached critical levels, underscoring the urgent need for innovative solutions.

According to the United Nations, an estimated 1.8 billion people are living in inadequate housing conditions globally, with 150 million people homeless. As the world's population continues to expand, the projected growth of the unhoused population demands immediate action. By 2030, the world is expected to witness an increase in urbanization, with two-thirds of the global population residing in cities.

Such rapid urbanization creates pressing demands for accessible and affordable housing options, especially for vulnerable communities.

To address these challenges and align with the SDG #1 mission to eradicate poverty, shipping container homes emerge as a promising solution. Shipping containers, once utilized solely for transporting goods, present a versatile and cost-effective alternative for housing.

According to the World Green Building Council, transforming shipping containers into dwellings can be 20–40 percent more affordable compared to traditional construction methods. Additionally, repurposing these containers reduces their environmental impact, promoting sustainability and aligning with the SDG 11 objective of creating sustainable cities and communities. Shipping container homes offer a customizable and efficient approach to meeting housing needs, providing insulated, secure, and easily deployable living spaces.

As you delve into building the Sustainable Stacks village, recognize the tremendous potential of this innovative solution, not only for SDG 1 and SDG 11, but also for the future of humanity.

By embracing creativity and sustainable practices, you can build a brighter, more inclusive world where affordable housing becomes a reality for all.
