## What Is the Educational Value of Fortnite Creative?

Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite are [sandbox environments](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#sandbox-game). These toolsets can be used to develop a variety of immersive interactive experiences. This includes games *and* educational and historical experiences such as the [TIME Studios March Through Time](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/march-through-time-experience-in-fortnite-creative)  experience.

On the underlying foundation of [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), students can take advantage of thousands of beautiful Fortnite assets to build experiences for areas and ideas that interest them. Studies show the educational value of games in learning and engagement, and Fortnite in the classroom is no exception.

By working with Fortnite, students have an opportunity to gain insights into game technology and design, develop new skills that can port into many areas of life, and to use the space to creatively employ their ideas and imaginations in building epic experiences — in every sense!
