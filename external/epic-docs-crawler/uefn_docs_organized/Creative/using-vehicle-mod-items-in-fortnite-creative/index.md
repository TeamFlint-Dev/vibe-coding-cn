To attach a vehicle mod, use the [aiming arc](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#aiming-arc) to throw the equipped mod at a vehicle.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

When you're back in [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) by pressing the **F** key.

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange items for another.

To do so, you can choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require [**Duct Tape**](using-nature-items-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Efficient Mechanical Parts**](using-mechanical-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative) as items needed to craft **Off-Road Tires**.
