In **Island Settings**, the **Overview** category provides access to tools that you can use to describe and publish an island. You can also make backups and restore from those backups if needed, and reset the island to its original settings.

Click the **Overview** category, then click an option in the **Tools** subcategory to access the settings for that tool.

[![The Overview category shows tools.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/28f07732-fc70-4ecd-add3-31c30b765340?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/28f07732-fc70-4ecd-add3-31c30b765340?resizing_type=fit)

## Edit Island Name and Description

This option opens a window where you can edit the island name and description.

[![Name and describe your island here.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c1ade591-90bf-40e0-baa5-18159c11efdd?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c1ade591-90bf-40e0-baa5-18159c11efdd?resizing_type=fit)

Your island name can be up to 40 characters.

Each line of the island description can take up to 150 characters, for a total of 450. This is a perfect place to start [onboarding players](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/onboarding-players-in-fortnite-creative).

When you change the name here, the new name appears in your console on the hub next time you access Creative. It also shows up in [Discover](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) when you look at an island details screen.

[![The name and description you enter shows up in Discover.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/44424bf5-a866-4eba-acab-34a06629386c?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/44424bf5-a866-4eba-acab-34a06629386c?resizing_type=fit)

*1. is the island name. 2. is the island description.*

Your island name and description shows up in the [Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#creator-portal), and any changes you make in Creator Portal will also show up here. (For more info, see [Publishing from the Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative)).

## Publish Island

Click the [Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/creator-portal-overview-in-fortnite-creative) link to log in to the Creator Portal if you're ready to publish your island. Click **Copy Private Code** to get a link you can share for playtesting.

Note that you can only publish your island if you're enrolled in the Creator Portal program, but you can still share your island with friends if you're not.

## Create Island Backup

Selecting this option immediately starts creating a backup of your island, and returns you to the island in Create mode.

This is useful if you want to make some major changes but you're not sure if they'll work and want to be able to return to a previous version if they don't.

If you return to the Overview category while the server is backing up your island, you'll see that both this option and the **Reset Island to Original State** option are grayed out. There's also a message saying "On cooldown" while the island is saved or reset.

## Restore from Backup

Selecting this option will immediately start to restore the most recent backup of your island.

[![Restore your island from most recent backup.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c2132f86-f090-4641-9b1a-e40dc2cb754b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c2132f86-f090-4641-9b1a-e40dc2cb754b?resizing_type=fit)

Click **Confirm** to complete the backup. You'll be returned to the island in Create mode while the island is restored. The length of time for the restore will vary based on how much memory you've used.

## Reset Island to Original State

This option will restore your island to its original state, meaning that you'll have the island in the same state as when you first created it.

This option removes all props and devices you've placed on the island, but leaves the name and description intact.

This is useful if you want to start over with a clean slate. You will be returned to the hub while the island reboots.
