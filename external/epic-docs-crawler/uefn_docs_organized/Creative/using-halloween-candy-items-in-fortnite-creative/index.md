Use the **Halloween Candy** [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to offer players a quick [status](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#status-effect) boost to aid in their gameplay. You can use these status boosts to give a temporary aid to the consuming player's [health](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#health), shield, vision, and movement.

Use devices that grant items like the **Item Granter** to offer these items to players.

Halloween Candy items include:

- **Candy Corn**
- **Hop Drop**
- **Jelly Bean**
- **Peppermint**
- **Thermal Taffy**

## Finding and Placing Items

[![Finding Halloween Candy](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f3a74161-6588-49a8-a3eb-3fba5bea10b2?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f3a74161-6588-49a8-a3eb-3fba5bea10b2?resizing_type=fit)

1. From **Create mode**, press the **Tab** key and click **CREATIVE** to select the [CREATIVE inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen.
2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.
3. On this screen, scroll to find and select the item, use the **Search** box to look up the item by name, or check the list of relevant **Categories** specific to the item you're looking for to filter the view.
4. Click the item, then either choose **EQUIP** or **ADD TO CHEST**.

Clicking EQUIP will add the item to your Equipment bar. (When you’re back in Create mode, you can view your Equipment bar by pressing the **F** key.)

You may want to create an item bundle to players through a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama). Selecting ADD TO CHEST will add the item to the [CHEST tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). Each time you click it, the item count will increase by one, shown in a yellow box on the CHEST tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the CHEST tab. When it’s full, the ADD TO CHEST tab will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the CHEST tab.

From the CHEST tab, you can select either CREATE CHEST or CREATE LLAMA to store the items in a Chest or a Llama for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).

## Managing Items

You can manage these items when you are in [Play inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#play-inventory). To access the **Play** inventory screen, press **Tab** and click **Play** in the top navigation bar. In the Play inventory screen, you can create or split item stacks, or remove them entirely from the Loadout bar.

Instead of dropping these items on the ground, it's best to grant them to players by using item-granting devices like the Item Spawner.

You cannot reposition or copy items with the phone tool. To delete an item from your inventory in Create mode, you will have to select either *Respawn* or *Back To Hub* from the *Menu*. When you do this, your inventory clears.

## Using Halloween Candy Items

To equip items in both [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode) and [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game), you can scroll with your middle mouse button or press the corresponding number from the Loadout bar on your keyboard.

You can also throw an item by equipping it, then holding down the right mouse button to aim. Once aimed, click the left mouse button to throw it where you aimed.

[![Items Throw](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/632abe4f-c458-40d8-8737-21f84a3cf386?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/632abe4f-c458-40d8-8737-21f84a3cf386?resizing_type=fit)

A blue [aiming arc](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#aiming-arc) indicates the distance and landing position of the throw.

The thrown item itself is indicated by a gray marker. You can use your middle mouse button to set and cancel the marker.
