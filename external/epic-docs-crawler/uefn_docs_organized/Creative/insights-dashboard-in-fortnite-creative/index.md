The **Insights dashboard** contains detailed information about player activity on your Fortnite Creative islands. Learn more about the number of players who play on your islands and return to play more, and the amount of time players spend on your islands.

## How It Works

Island data is pulled daily to give you an in-depth look at the number of visiting players, how long players typically stick on your islands, and how many return. You can see your top performing islands and the number of new players, as well as weekly and monthly data.

Set the data you want to see in a number of ways, first by selecting the game view under Games Shown and the date range under Time Range Parameters.

### Game Shown

| Selectors |
| --- |
| Selected Games |
| Recently Published |
| My Top 10 games |
| My Top 10 Trending Games |

### Time Range Parameters

| Player Data | Time Range |
| --- | --- |
| Daily | Last 7 days |
| Weekly | Last 7 days |
| Monthly | Last month  Last 3 months  Select Time Range |

**Time Range Parameters** are a common feature across multiple graphs. Use the Time Range Parameters to set the time frame you want to analyze by selecting from **Live** data, **Daily** data, **Weekly** data, or **Monthly** data. You can also select the dates you want to view island information for from the month dropdown menu. The default is always set to the current date.

Selecting graph data can be done by:

1. Selecting the time range you want to see: **Live**, **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**.
2. Selecting dates from the **Calendar** menu.
3. Selecting the island or islands from the **Top Games** menu to the right of the **Calendar** menu.

The graph’s data changes after a selection is made in one of the selectors in the table above.

### Selected

Use the **Selected** dropdown menu to search for a particular island or more than one island. The default dashboard view is the data relating to the islands you selected the last time you were on the dashboard. The selected dropdown menu is available for all analytic graphs in Fortnie Games Dashboard.

### Best Practices

Following are recommended guidelines to help you get the most out of the information available on your [dashboard](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary).

- Some [metrics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#metrics) offer daily updates. Check those metrics daily for up-to-date information on your top performing islands to make sure that their metrics remain steady.
- If you are interested only in certain metrics, you can download the insight [metrics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#metrics) for those parameters individually.
- By releasing new features regularly and keeping notes on what you updated, you can identify changes in the performance and success based on those changes.
- Often data can be subject to forces outside of your control — seasonal variation or changes in player behavior for example — so avoid jumping to conclusions based on short-term data you see. If player metrics drop for a day or two then go back to normal, things are fine.

## My Total Active Players

Use **My Total Players** data to see patterns in active player activity, then use the data to engage with players during times when your island does not have many [active players](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#active-players).

To increase interest in your games, reach out to the Fortnite community and your supporters on social media. Use this information to understand relevant traffic data for your islands during the period of time you select.

Promoting your islands can result in an increase of player traffic to your Fortnite Creative islands. Use this information to learn about the types of islands players like to engage with so you can create more islands in that style and build more islands that have interesting objectives similar to your most actively played islands.

### My Total Active Players Quick View

Above the graph, the dashboard gives you data on the number of players playing on the selected islands under four categories:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Peak All Time**\* | Gives you insight into the largest amount of peak player traffic to your selected islands since you published them. |
| **Peak Today** | Gives you insight into the amount of peak player traffic your selected islands had today. |
| **AVG. All Time** | Gives you insight into the average number of players who have played on the selected islands since you published them. |
| **AVG. Today** | Gives you the average number of players who played on the selected islands today. |

Peak Today and AVG. Today also displays a percentage of increased activity relating to the number of players on the selected islands for today.

## Average Play Time

The [Average Play Time](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) graph shows the average amount of time players spend completing game objectives for the islands you select and during the time range you set in the calendar dropdown menu.

Use this information to learn why some of your islands hold the interest of players longer than others. Go back to your islands that underperform and add more interesting objectives, game play, spawn pads, weapons, or whatever you think might make a difference with players.

Check the results of any changes you made in a week or a month to see if the changes you made to the islands make a difference with players.

After making tweaks to your islands, go on social media and highlight the changes you have made to get your supporters interested in playing these islands over again to see the changes you made. You could even get players to vote on the changes you made to see whether they liked them.

If the changes result in increased player traffic, update the island video and highlight your changes.

## New Fortnite Ecosystem Players

Use [New Fortnite Ecosystem Players](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to learn about the number of players new to the Fortnite Ecosystem who have visited your islands.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e1ac77f8-9619-4cd1-98d7-a17d6deb5788?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e1ac77f8-9619-4cd1-98d7-a17d6deb5788?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

The **New Fortnite Ecosystem Players** metrics measure the number of new players who visit your island on their first day playing Fortnite as well as how your islands are performing at bringing new users into the Fortnite ecosystem. New users can move between your island to or from another Creative island, any Epic experience, Item Shop, or elsewhere in Fortnite and still count as a new user on your island.

This metric is determined by the status of a player. While changes on your island may impact the number of new users, these players can only be counted as "New" once.

## Players Returning to Fortnite Ecosystem

[Players Returning to Fortnite Ecosystem](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) metrics use the total number of players who return to Fortnite after a gap of 28 days or more—in other words, players who play your island on the day they play Fortnite after an absence of 28 or more days.

[![](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5daa41ab-d6fd-499d-97d3-4ea3a84a11cc?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/5daa41ab-d6fd-499d-97d3-4ea3a84a11cc?resizing_type=fit)

*Click image to enlarge.*

The **Players Returning to Fortnite Ecosystem** graph shows you how many players who had lapsed from the Fortnite ecosystem are returning to Fortnite by engaging with your island(s).

This metric is determined by the status of a player. While changes on your island may impact the number of returning users, these players can only be counted as "Returning" after a concurrent lapse of 28+ days.

## Island Retention

Use the [Daily Retention Rate](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) graph to see how many players return to play your islands two days in a row over a period of time you determine.

This data can help you understand why players are returning to some of your games two days in a row at a higher rate than others. You can adjust settings and gameplay to try to increase retention on your lower-performing islands.

Combining the insights you gain from **Daily Retention** and **Average Play Time** can help you piece together what players find engaging about the islands they return to and spend more time playing.

Playtesting your islands after getting your island data can also give you insight into what players are experiencing during game play. If possible, try to play your games on more than one device (desktop, console, and so on) to learn what players on different platforms are experiencing on your islands.

## Total Lifetime Plays

**Total Lifetime Plays** shows the total amount of plays your islands have had since publication. Select the number of islands you want to see Lifetime Play data for from the **Selected** menu.

Use the Lifetime Play information to get a better understanding of how all your islands perform over time. You may never get all your islands to the same level of engagement with players, but you can understand more about how players interact with your islands by collecting and comparing your island data.

To select the data you want to see in the Total Lifetime Plays graph, select the island or islands from the **Top Games** menu on the right of the Calendar menu.

The data in the graph will automatically change to display the data you selected above.

### Total Lifetime Quick View

See Total Lifetime Play data on the overall amount of visits for all the islands and the island with **Overall Selected Visits** and **Most Visited Selection**. Overall Selected Visits provides data on the overall player visits to the islands you selected, Most Visited Selection provides data on the most visited islands you selected.

These insights show the total visits your selected islands have received since publication, and the total number visiting your most visited islands.

## My Overall Highlights

**My Overall Highlights** gives you an overview of player activity across your islands, from **Total Unique Players**, to the total amount of **Monthly**, **Weekly**, and **Total Lifetime Plays**. Each section provides player growth data for your islands represented by the number displayed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Total Unique Players** | This updates daily with a cumulative total that shows how many unique, individual players have discovered your island. |
| **Monthly Players** | Updates daily with a cumulative total number of monthly players playing on your islands. |
| **Weekly Players** | Updates daily with a cumulative total number of players playing on your published islands. |
| **Total Lifetime Plays** | Updates daily and shows you the total number of players who have visited your islands from the time you published your games. |

Compare the data from My Overall Highlights month-over-month to view the player history on your islands.You can see if the total number of unique players results in an increased [retention rate](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) for your islands over the following weeks and months.

Alternatively, you might find that your retention rate drops after the original increase in total unique players. If this is the case, use the data from **Average Play Time** to gauge which islands are losing player interest, then play those islands yourself to see what players are experiencing.

You might find that some islands need adjustments to make them more engaging. Remember to post any changes you make on your social channels to renew interest in those games and drive more player traffic to your islands.

## My Top Performing Games

**My Top Performing Games** provides updates on players visiting your top performing islands. This panel shows weekly numerical data for your islands by: **My Most Popular Game**, **Highest Growth**, **Highest Average Play Time** and **Most Visited Game**.

Getting player feedback on your other games helps you to understand where to make adjustments to levels, characters, and objectives, and find the exact places where your islands could use a change to make them more interesting to your supporters and other Fortnite Creative players.

When you make changes based on feedback, be sure to thank your supporters and talk about the modifications you made to your islands on your social channels to increase interest in your islands and drive more player traffic to them.

Use this information to follow changes in player behavior across your top 10 islands and to gain insight into which of your top 10 islands are underperforming. You might want to get player feedback on your islands from the Fortnite Creative community, or ask friends to play your islands on different platforms and give you their feedback.

If you change the videos for an underperforming island to include more engaging content, and promote the island after you tweak it, this can help draw fresh players to your islands and bring back players who have played your islands before.
