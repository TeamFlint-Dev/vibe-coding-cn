## Core Differences between Fortnite Creative and Minecraft

There are a few basic differences between Fortnite Creative and Minecraft.

### Building

In Minecraft, everything is built block by block, offering a multitude of possibilities and flexibility for creators to stretch their creativity. You can also procedurally generate a world with preset buildings, but these structures are uneditable.

In Fortnite Creative, there are thousands of ready-to-use assets for creating an island [experience](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#experience). This includes a range of items, from [prefabricated buildings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prefab) and other building components, like walls and doors, to [gallery items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#gallery) and props such as furniture. In addition to structural or building assets, Creative also includes a variety of player [items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and customizable devices that provide a lot of game design flexibility and creativity.

### Coding and Customization

Another core difference between the two is the way coding and customization works.

In Minecraft, redstone is used to transmit input and output signals between objects. This, combined with coding, gives creators a way to build and customize their worlds.

Fortnite supports the creation and design of experiences through the use of specialized [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) that enable interactions and [mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics) without the need for custom code.
