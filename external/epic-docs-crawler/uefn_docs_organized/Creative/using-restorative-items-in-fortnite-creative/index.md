1. From [Create mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#create-mode), press the **Tab** key, then click **CREATIVE** on the [top navigation bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) to select the [CREATIVE inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) screen if not already displayed.
2. Click the **CONSUMABLES** tab.

4. Click the item, then click either **Equip** or **Add To Chest**.

Clicking **Equip** will add the item to your [Equipment bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary). When you're back in Create mode, you can view any items you've [equipped](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) by pressing the **F** key. You can select equipped items by either scrolling your middle mouse button or by pressing its corresponding number on your keyboard.

From the [Chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) tab, you can select either **Create Chest** or **Create Llama** to store the items in a [chest](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#chest) or a [llama](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#llama) for use [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game).

Chests and llamas are a great way to offer item bundles to players. Selecting **Add To Chest** will add the item to the **Chest** tab. Each time you click **Add To Chest**, the item count will increase by one, shown as a yellow box on the Chest tab.

You can add up to fifteen items to the **Chest** tab. When it’s full, the **Add To Chest** button will disappear. To add more items, you first have to remove items from the **Chest** tab.

There are many ways to offer these items to players. Use any of the devices under the [Registering Items](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-restorative-items-in-fortnite-creative#registering-items) section to either offer or require these items during gameplay.

*To register items to a device, stand directly on or immediately beside the device.*

To register an item for this kind of device, follow the steps below. (You can also watch a [video tutorial](https://mediaspace.unrealengine.com/media/RegisteringCraftingConsumablesinFortniteCreative/1_zpmj3v0g) that shows you how to register items, for [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting) or other [in-game](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#in-game) use.)

1. In the CREATIVE inventory, find the equipment and items you want to register with a device and equip them.
2. In Create mode, stand directly beside the device that will register the item.
3. Press the **Tab** key to open the **PLAY** inventory screen.
4. Click the item, then press either **Z** or **X** to split or drop the item. You can also drag the item to the side until a [backpack icon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#backpack-icon) appears.

The compatible device will automatically register the dropped item. Compatible devices that can hold items include:

- **Vending Machine**
- **Team Settings & Inventory**
- **Class Designer**
- **Capture Item Spawner**
- **Capture Area**
- **Item Granter**
- **Item Spawner**
- **Conditional Button**

Use these devices to set up your own system for granting and spawning items onto your island.

## Using Items for Crafting

You can pair items with each other and with weapons to create the process of [crafting](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#crafting), where players exchange one item or group of items for another.

To do this, choose from the list of compatible devices above like the [**Conditional Button**](using-conditional-button-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and [**Item Spawner**](using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) to set up the crafting process.

For example, you can require **[Bacon](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-wild-edible-crafting-items-in-fortnite-creative)** and **[Blue Mushrooms](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-nature-items-in-fortnite-creative)** as items needed to craft **Pizza Slice**.
