The player's goal in **Lava Bounce** is to avoid the lava by jumping across the gaps between Pinball Bumper devices and landing safely on the final platform to collect their prize!

Find the devices you need in the [Devices tab](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) of the [Creative inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) and add them to your [Quick Bar](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#quick-bar).

### Setting Up the Hover Platform Devices

1. [Place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wceTxlUAJ4) a [Hover Platform](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-hover-platform-devices-in-fortnite-creative) so that it floats above the lava. This will act as your starting point. Press the **B** key to open the **Quick Menu** and make sure **DROPS** is set to **OFF** so the platform floats above the lava.

   [![Settings DROPS to OFF in the Quick Menu Options.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f4fa3ca4-997c-4f74-8d02-f860c510a3eb?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/f4fa3ca4-997c-4f74-8d02-f860c510a3eb?resizing_type=fit)

   [![A creator placing Hover Platform over the lava.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c2041469-6b70-442d-880c-5a6450b67d89?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c2041469-6b70-442d-880c-5a6450b67d89?resizing_type=fit)

   Double click the spacebar to [fly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o7AvUuoDw8) and place items with ease over the lava.
2. Go back into the **Quick Menu** to set **DROPS** to **ON** so that when you place the [Player Spawn Pad](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-player-spawn-pad-devices-in-fortnite-creative) in the center of the Hover Platform, the Spawn Pad lands on the platform. Rotate the Player Spawn Pad so the player spawns towards the side where you will put the Pinball Bumper path. You don't need to modify the device options, as the default options work for this example.

3. Place the first [Pinball Bumper](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/using-pinball-bumper-devices-in-fortnite-creative) above the lava surface. Place the Pinball Bumper near the edge of the Hover Platform so that the player can jump from the Hover Platform and land on the Pinball Bumper beneath it.

   [![A creator placing the first Pinball Bumper below the Hover Platform so that the player can jump from the Hover Platform and land on the Pinball Bumper.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/187b54d8-3502-4a7a-9d39-4ff7ab3c5809?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/187b54d8-3502-4a7a-9d39-4ff7ab3c5809?resizing_type=fit)
4. Customize the Pinball Bumper device using the values below.

   | Option | Value | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Knockback** | **Very High** | Launches the player high into the air so they can deploy their glider. |
   | **Fall Damage** | **Off** | Prevents players from taking damage while using the Pinball Bumper device. |
   | **Allow Side Bounce** | **Off** | Ensures the Pinball Bumper knocks players directly up when they land on top of it. |
   | **Bumper Color** | **Orange Glow** | Sets the device to orange glow to compliment the lava colors and gameplay theme. |

   [![The device options for the Pinball Bumper.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9d7ab089-3c79-43cc-9f02-75a349be0c79?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9d7ab089-3c79-43cc-9f02-75a349be0c79?resizing_type=fit)
5. Place the 10 Pinball Bumper devices in a path along the lava surface. Position them closely enough that the player can bounce from one bumper to the next. Use the same device option values for all the Pinball Bumper devices.

   [![A creator placing Pinball Bumpers in a line evenly spaced after the start Hover Platform.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c0fc75f2-eba5-4b20-b3b0-41d35333fd82?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c0fc75f2-eba5-4b20-b3b0-41d35333fd82?resizing_type=fit)

   To save time, copy and paste the first pinball device with the updated device options to create the Pinball Bumper path. Hover your cursor over the Pinball Bumper device and right click to copy, and right click again to paste the device in a new location.
6. Place the two final Hover Platforms. Place one Hover Platform slightly forward and above the final Pinball Bumper. Place a second Hover Platform slightly forward and above from the first Hover Platform.

   [![Placing the second final platform above and forward from the first platform.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9fc71e3f-946b-4d1e-bbf2-1bb8e9c099c1?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/9fc71e3f-946b-4d1e-bbf2-1bb8e9c099c1?resizing_type=fit)
7. Place a final Pinball Bumper in the middle of the edge closest to the second platform. Change the Pinball Bumper option **Knockback** to **High**. Keep all the other device options from the device options table above. The player will use the final Pinball Bumper to catapult from the first platform to the second platform.

   | Option | Value | Description |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | **Knockback** | **High** | Launches the player into the air so they can jump to the next platform. |

8. Place the Collectible Gallery somewhere convenient, then select a single collectible object to place on the center of the second Hover Platform. Delete the rest of the gallery. This item is the player’s prize for completing the Lava Bounce game!

## Customize My Island Settings

Before your island is ready, you need to configure the [My Island settings](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary) so your game will play properly.

Open your inventory and select the **My Island** tab to begin, then make the following changes to the **GAME** and **SETTINGS** tabs. You can change other options as well if you want, but these are required for the gameplay example to function correctly.

### Game

[![A screenshot showing COLLECT ITEMS TO END set to 1.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/af00398f-9ffe-4ced-9ae3-82984c2ade0b?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/af00398f-9ffe-4ced-9ae3-82984c2ade0b?resizing_type=fit)

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **COLLECT ITEMS TO END** | 1 | Picking up 1 collectible item ends the game. |

### Settings

[![A screenshot showing ENVIRONMENT DAMAGE set to OFF.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6d985acc-dbdc-48a7-a960-9934428fc4a8?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6d985acc-dbdc-48a7-a960-9934428fc4a8?resizing_type=fit)

| Option | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **ENVIRONMENT DAMAGE** | Off | Prevents players from damaging the environment. |

### Optional Challenges

If you want to make your version of the Lava Bounce more difficult, try the following changes to the My Island settings.

- Make your players bounce on the Pinball Bumpers more, instead of using their glider!
  In the **Settings** tab, change **Glider Redeploy** to **Off**. Now players can't use their gliders to bypass the Pinball Bumpers.
- Make the lava more dangerous!
  In the **Settings** tab, change **Max Health** to **1**. Now the lava will eliminate the player on contact.
