This series of lessons has been designed to provide flexibility. Each lesson is set up as a stand-alone lesson to teach a coding concept in isolation in the span of about an hour as part of the Hour of Code initiative. The teacher can choose which lesson students complete or students can choose one (or more) that appeal to them.

The lessons also work together so that a student could complete all five lessons and create a game experience with five different puzzles demonstrating the different concepts. Likewise, students can work in groups where each student or small group completes one of the activities as part of a larger project.

Each lesson is accompanied by a student guide with notes to guide the educator in delivering the lesson and supporting the students in the process.
