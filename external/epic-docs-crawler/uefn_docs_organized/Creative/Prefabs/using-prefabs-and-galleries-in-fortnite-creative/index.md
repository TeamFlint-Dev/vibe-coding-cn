Want to create a western town? A medieval village? A futuristic techno-punk shopping mall? Find what you need to outfit your island in the Creative Content **Prefabs** and **Galleries** categories!

## Access Prefabs and Galleries

1. From your Creative island, activate your Phone tool, then press the **Tab** key.
2. Select **Content**.

3. From here, you can go to the Prefabs or Galleries categories to explore the wide range of assets available.

Check out the [Building Basics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/building-basics-in-fortnite-creative) section, which shows how to use prefab and gallery pieces to build structures like arenas and pre-game lobbies.

## Prefabs

A **prefab** is a prefabricated structure. It could be a piece of furniture, like a chair or a table, a fully-furnished building, or anything in between.

When you double-click a prefab in Creative Content, you can see all of the items that make up that prefab. You can equip a single item from a prefab by selecting only that item, or you can go back and select and equip the entire prefab.

If you equip the entire prefab, you can still move or remove individual components once you've placed it on your island, or you can select and manipulate the entire prefab.

Below is a description of each theme, and what those themes cover. Use the theme name listed to search for prefabs that fit that theme.

*Searching for a theme like farm will return all of the prefabs that use a farm theme.*

### Prefab Themes

| Theme | Asset Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cabin** | Woods and forest, and camping structures |
| **Castle** | Medieval castle, dungeon, or fantasy-type structures |
| **Farm** | Farm and farmland structures |
| **Industrial** | Warehouse, factory, and city structures |
| **Military** | Government facilities and secret bases |
| **Residential** | Homes and personal dwelling structures |
| **Prehistoric** | Ancient or preindustrial-inspired structures |
| **Retail** | Shopping and restaurant structures |
| **Seaside** | Coastal, ocean, and water-based structures |
| **Sports** | Athletic and competitive activity-based structures |
| **Terrain** | Landscapes and land formations |
| **Western** | American Old West and desert-themed structures |

## Galleries

A **gallery** is a collection of assets with a related theme. Unlike a prefab, a gallery is not assembled into any kind of structure. You can, however, use gallery components like windows, walls, and doors, to build your own custom structures.

When you double-click a gallery in Creative Content, you can expand it to see all of the assets contained within that gallery. You can select and equip the entire gallery, but as a creator, you'll probably find it more useful to expand the gallery and only equip specific items.

Below is a description of each gallery theme, and what those themes cover. You can use the theme name to search for galleries that fit that theme.

### Gallery Themes

| **Audio and Visual Effects** | Music, sound, and lighting props |
