A **template island** helps you get started with a specific design concept or [game mode](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mode), such as a [zone war](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#zone-war), [box fight](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#box-fight), or [escape](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#escape-game) island.

Each [template island](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#template-island) gives you the opportunity to review the [game mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics) and [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) used to create them. You can also alter the island to fit with your own design.

## How to Use Template Documentation

Some templates have [tutorials](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#tutorial) to go with them, providing more details and information about the template construction and how the island experience was put together. You can use these tutorials with the island templates for a more in-depth view, or as a guide to creating your own island experience.
