## Create Your Own Fall Guys Island

The **Fall Guys** starter island includes a sample obstacle course for you to play around with the toolset. It contains some simple mechanics and platforming puzzles.

[![starter island obstacle course](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c15ed452-0360-4456-9429-747e01735589?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/c15ed452-0360-4456-9429-747e01735589?resizing_type=fit)

The other islands are blank, and are based on existing Fortnite starter islands and templates with the Fall Guys feature set:

- Fall Guys Empty Grid
- Fall Guys Empty Large Grid
- Fall Guys Empty XL Grid
- Fall Guys Empty Shoreline

All the starter islands on the Fall Guys islands have things in common:

- You will respawn in the hub as a Fall Guys Bean character.
- Each island already has a Player Spawner device so you will spawn into the island directly. Beans don't skydive!
- All the Fall Guys islands are already set up with the island settings and restrictions specific to Fall Guys.

### From Creative

Get to the Creative hub and open the **Console** next to your golden rift. Click **Create New,** then select the **Fall Guys** tab and you can see the Fall Guys island templates available.

### From Unreal Editor for Fortnite

You can access the Fall Guys islands in the UEFN Project Browser from the **Brand****Templates** section. Name your project and click **Create.**

## Ready, Set, Build!
