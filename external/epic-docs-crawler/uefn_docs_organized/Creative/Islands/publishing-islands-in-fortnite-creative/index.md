Whether you’re publishing from Fortnite Creative or from Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), the Creative Portal is where you go to publish your islands. The portal provides everything you’ll need to prepare and submit your island.

## How Good Is Good Enough?

Part of game design is [iteration](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#iterate). You design an experience, test it with players, correct any issues, then test again.

When you publish your island for the first time, you can expect it to be a work in progress. Getting it published makes it possible to invite friends to play, and you can get feedback from them on how it can be improved.

It is likely that you'll constantly be tweaking the [mechanics](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#game-mechanics) of your game as you learn more about harnessing the tools available in Creative, and as new [props](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#prop) and [devices](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#device) are released that you want to incorporate into your [gameplay](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#gameplay). It's not unusual for a seasoned Creator to put out a new version as often as once a week.

Making changes to your game experience also gives you a reason to promote on social media. Followers and supporters will want to see your improvements over time. And if you start with perfection, you’ll have no room for improvement!

So how good does your island have to be before you publish? Good enough to give players a little fun, good enough to catch their attention. And good enough to make them interested in coming back for more as you refine the experience.

The list of documents below will familiarize you with the publishing steps, and all the features available from the Publishing tab.
