This feature is currently experimental. This means that you can use the feature for testing and feedback, but with the understanding that the feature may change before full release. You cannot publish an island that contains an experimental feature.

**In-Island Transactions** provides a way for you to create your own in-game economy by offering items to players in exchange for V-Bucks. Use Verse to define the item name, description, and price (in V-Bucks). Review your catalog of offers and monitor sales performance from within [Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) while the system ensures a central, unchangeable record of every transaction.
