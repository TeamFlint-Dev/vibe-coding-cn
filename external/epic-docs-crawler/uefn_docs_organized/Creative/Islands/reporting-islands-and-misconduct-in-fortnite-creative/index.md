While creating or playing other islands, you may come across content that you believe is illegal. Illegal content includes any content or behavior that breaks the law in any country. There are several places where you can report creators and islands for illegal content or misconduct.

This does not include improper use of IP (intellectual property) assets. To report IP violations, see the [Reporting Intellectual Property Infringement](https://www.epicgames.com/site/infringement).

For more information on what assets are considered illegal and in violation of Epic's  policies, see the [Epic Games Content Guidelines](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/content-guidelines).

## Reporting from Creator Portal

To report illegal content from Creator Portal:

1. Go to the Project Overview page.
