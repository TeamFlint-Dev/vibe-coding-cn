9. Confirm your eligibility for the program. If you are eligible, decide on your Creator Code. If you are not eligible, carefully review the eligibility requirements, then apply again when you meet them.

   [![Confirm that you're eligible for publishing and monetization.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6f1b5964-22e0-4f86-9bf4-75e0f9538996?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/6f1b5964-22e0-4f86-9bf4-75e0f9538996?resizing_type=fit)
10. Enter your Creator Code in the **Choose Your Creator Code** field. This Creator Code will be the creator name your islands will be published under, and it will be displayed in Fortnite next to your islands. Your Creator Code must meet the following requirements:

    - Must be between 3 and 16 characters.
    - Must only contain alphanumeric characters, underscore [\_], dash [-], or dot [.].
    - Must be consistent with the Epic Games [Community Rules](https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/community-rules).

    - A Creator Code is separate from your Epic account display name. However, if you want, the Creator Code can be the same as your display name. You can only change your creator code once every 12 months, so take your time with this step!
    - If you’ve previously signed up for the Support-A-Creator program, you do not get to choose your Creator Code. Your existing Creator Code will display and is unchangeable during signup.

## Setting Up Your Tax Profile and Hyperwallet Account

You are required to complete a tax Interview via an external service called **Tax Identity**.

Epic is required to collect taxpayer information in order to fulfill tax withholding and reporting obligations. To do this, you fill out a short online tax interview that gathers all the information necessary to create your tax profile and generate a Form W-9 for US island creators or Form W-8 for Non-US island creators. We do this through an external service provided by [Tax Identity](http://www.taxidentity.com/).

Verification can take up to five business days, depending on your country. Epic will send you an email when your tax information is verified.

If you are exempt from needing to enter tax and/or payout information, please contact [Epic Games Support](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/?sessionInvalidated=true) for further assistance.

If you have any questions about the Tax Interview process, see [Set Up Your Tax Profile](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/tax-profile-setup-in-fortnite-creative).

Once you submit your Tax Interview, Tax Identity validates your tax profile. It will take some time for this validation to occur. This takes a couple of hours in most cases, but may take longer depending on your country and the information you have submitted.

After your tax profile is validated, you will receive an email that includes instructions to activate your new payout account. Follow the instructions in the email carefully to activate your Hyperwallet payout account. If you have any questions during this process, see [Set Up Your Hyperwallet Account](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/hyperwallet-setup-in-fortnite-creative).

Once your payout account is activated, you will receive an email from Epic Games with instructions to complete your registration.

When you return to the Creator Portal, you will find features that are now unlocked for you, including the ability to [publish your islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative) to Fortnite.

You are all set!

If you have a strong social following, take advantage of it by also joining the [Support-A-Creator program](https://sac.epicgames.com/en-US/overview) if you haven't already!
