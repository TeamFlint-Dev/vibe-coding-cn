Set your inner child free and create a magical, fantastical, quirky LEGO® experience in Fortnite Creative and Unreal Editor for Fortnite. LEGO® Islands feature more than just exclusive content — they also have custom settings, a unique scale, and more that makes them a uniquely LEGO experience!

Building with LEGO assets means learning to think about how to use these assets inside Fortnite. Players move and interact on a LEGO Island in the same way Fortnite characters do, just on a smaller scale, and with a few features just for these islands.

After creating, playtesting, and perfecting your LEGO Island, you'll be ready to publish and share your LEGO vision with the world, so take the time to make sure it lines up with the **[LEGO® Brand and Creator Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative)**.

## LEGO Templates

You can get started creating your LEGO Island from templates. These templates are pre-configured with LEGO scale and settings so you can focus on building and gameplay.

[![images of the three template islands](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e4b91e6d-4fb8-498e-891a-b7261742f9df?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/e4b91e6d-4fb8-498e-891a-b7261742f9df?resizing_type=fit)

Templates can range from blank islands to gameplay-filled islands with learning content.

To explore the full range of official LEGO templates, and learn how to build off of general templates, see [LEGO Templates](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-templates-in-fortnite).

Make the island of your LEGO dreams! There are no bad ideas! (Just ask Master Builder Emmet Brickowski).

## LEGO Bricks and Scale

The LEGO® Brick Editor provides a way for you to build objects that you design using brick-by-brick building. The index of bricks contains an assortment of different original LEGO brick types and colors.

Bricks have 5:6 width and height dimensions. The building system uses [studs and tubes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/building-lego-islands-in-fortnite#learn-a-little-lego-lingo) to snap bricks together. A stud measures 1.6 mm and shows the LEGO logo.

[![The actual dimensions of LEGO bricks.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8b1f8bd2-3add-4b71-a739-cb91283044d7?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/8b1f8bd2-3add-4b71-a739-cb91283044d7?resizing_type=fit)

One 1 x 1 brick is the same height as three plates. A 1 x 2 plate has the same width and height dimensions as five stacked 1 x 1 plates. Bricks snap to 90 degree increments in the viewport for accurate placement in brick-by-brick building.

In the editor, bricks are 20 times bigger than they are in real life.

Bricks from the index of bricks cannot be scaled. LEGO bricks are required to maintain their uniform scale across all projects according to the [LEGO Brand Guidelines](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative). When using the LEGO Brick Editor, the scaling function is disabled. Project validators programmatically ensure that this rule is followed.

### Project Validators

Validations are run on objects built using the LEGO Brick Editor to ensure all bricks and kragled objects are used as is from the Brick Gallery, and are not changed in any fundamental way. There are two types of validation run on brick-built objects that check for:

- Materials applied to the individual bricks and kragled meshes.

  The only way to change the appearance of a brick is to change its color in the Brick Editor.
- Identify the scale of the bricks in the level.

When building in the editor, you’ll receive warnings generated by the validator when it detects bricks that collide with other LEGO objects. Bricks that collide and intersect with other objects have a red visual cue to indicate that the meshes have an issue and may jump to another position on the grid when you release the brick object with your mouse.

The overlap validator may make mistakes from time-to-time, especially with kragled meshes that have heavily optimized collision volumes. To avoid this issue, use the **Separate** tool to unkragle your build, then kragle the repeating patterns together that you can snap together to reduce validation errors.

Prop and prefab content from the Content Browser cannot be un-kragled, nor kragled together with objects built using the LEGO Brick Editor. Props and prefabs cannot be selected when in LEGO Brick Editor mode, because the editor considers them non-LEGO UEFN props and assets.

## LEGO Island Scale and Mechanics

LEGO Islands have a special scale to accommodate the [LEGO® Minifigure](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#minifigure)-sized players, and special building mechanics for control and movement of your props. The scale and building mechanics are adapted to support LEGO assets and templates.

### Scale

LEGO Islands use a Minifigure scale which is 0.5 Unreal Units, or half of Fortnite Creative’s default snap settings. The LEGO scale is already established on a LEGO template so you don’t have to worry about setting your island to match.

### Minifigure Movement

In game, players spawn as Minifigures on your LEGO Islands and move around much the same as they do in LEGO Fortnite. Players can walk, run, swim, and jump, but they won’t be able to hangglide, hurdle, or slide. Life is challenging with bricks for feet!

### Quick Menu

The Quick Menu has most of the same customizable features as Fortnite, but there are a couple of differences

[![The Quick Menu in a LEGO template does not have the Drop or Building as Prop options.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0fd8c740-803d-4bd6-9273-f5baf4712f0d?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/0fd8c740-803d-4bd6-9273-f5baf4712f0d?resizing_type=fit)

In a LEGO template the following option is not available from the Quick Menu:

- **Drops:** There is no option to drop LEGO assets. Nothing is worse than dropping a fully-built LEGO set.

These options have some features that could be used to go against the [**LEGO® Brand and Creator Rules**](lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative).

## Building with LEGO Elements

All assets work with the grid-snapping system. Building on your own LEGO Island should feel much the same as building in Fortnite, just smaller — but without feeling smaller.

The current available memory in the LEGO templates is small however, so to make more memory available, delete assets you intend to change.

You’ll spawn onto your island as a Minifigure. Your Minifigure uses the [Phone tool](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#phone) to grab, rotate, and place LEGO assets, no assembly required.

If you don’t like where you placed something, delete it and watch what happens. LEGO assets destruct by falling apart in a shower of LEGO bricks!

To get the true bricks-falling-apart experience, open the **Sidebar** > **Settings** menus and change the **Anti-Aliasing and Super Resolution** setting to one of the following:

- **FXAA**
- **TAA**
- **NVIDIA DLSS**

Use the LEGO building galleries to create tailor-made homes.

As you continue building with walls and roofs, you’ll need to use **pillars** to fill in gaps, since the walls are slightly smaller than the grid.

Lego Islands have unique building constraints:

- LEGO assets can’t overlap one another.
- LEGO assets can’t be scaled.
- Fortnite building props (walls, floors, and other similar props) also can’t be scaled on a LEGO Island.

In UEFN you can overlap [LEGO Elements](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/fortnite-creative-glossary#lego-elements), but this will cause your island to fail Epic's moderation process.

You can mix and match LEGO assets with Fortnite’s inventory of available props, prefabs, and galleries. Fortnite assets are automatically scaled to Minifigure-size and behave as they do in Fortnite when destroyed.

### Working with Devices

Look through the LEGO Device inventory and you’ll find many of the familiar Fortnite devices, but with a few exceptions. All devices have the same functionality you’re used to in Fortnite and have been modified to work with Minifigures.

Some devices can be used in interesting ways on LEGO Islands. For example, the [Hover Platform](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-hover-platform-devices-in-fortnite-creative) device can be used to build in the air and add some interesting gameplay for players.

Devices that use text input such as the [Billboard device](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-billboard-devices-in-fortnite-creative) and spawn items such as the [Item Spawner](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/using-item-spawner-devices-in-fortnite-creative) receive extra moderation to ensure the devices follow the LEGO Brand and Creator Rules.

Be sure to visit **[LEGO® Asset Inventory](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-asset-inventory-in-fortnite-creative)** for a visual list of the available LEGO content.

### Game Mechanics and Game Design

Think about game mechanics that teach players how to perform a task, use teamwork to accomplish a goal, or interact with the island and other assets for a reward.

Some devices will not be available for use on a LEGO template island, such as racing devices, and certain spawners. These devices have options that go against [LEGO Brand Rules](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/lego-brand-and-creator-rules-in-fortnite-creative), are militaristic by design, or could be used to introduce content that goes against the IARC age restrictions.

Islands with devices that support text input and that spawn items go through an extra review process.

[![An example of a LEGO Island.](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/83cedf50-6caf-44e1-9437-a65dccc93af4?resizing_type=fit)](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/api/documentation/image/83cedf50-6caf-44e1-9437-a65dccc93af4?resizing_type=fit)

With these boundaries in mind, get creative with your game design. Create glyphs for players in Fortnite by [incorporating cutscenes](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/making-cinematics-and-cutscenes-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite) in UEFN for completing a task and using technical arts to teach players how to interact with your game.

This can be as simple as using volume devices to add contrast between areas, ensuring objects players are meant to interact with have a common theme, , or use visual displays to communicate that theme.

## Publishing LEGO Islands

Publishing a LEGO Island follows the same process as publishing any other Fortnite Creative island through Creator Portal. To learn more about the publishing process, refer to **[Publishing from Creator Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/publishing-from-the-creator-portal-in-fortnite-creative)**.
