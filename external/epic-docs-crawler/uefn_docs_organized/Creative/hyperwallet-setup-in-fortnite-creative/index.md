**Hyperwallet** is a payout application that provides distribution of payouts in local currencies.

As a third party, separate from Epic, Hyperwallet collects and stores personal information in order to handle distribution of payouts on behalf of Epic Games.

This platform is not a digital wallet in the sense that you can store, add to, and distribute payments to vendors. No funds are held in your Hyperwallet account. Instead, it receives funds from Epic, then transfers your funds to where you set up for receipt.

Once your program application is approved, you'll get an email. Follow the instructions in the email to start your Hyperwallet setup.

If you've already successfully set up a Hyperwallet account, you can change your tax profile or payout information at any time from your program's portal. Then reach out to [Player Support](https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/) to ensure the changes are also made to your Hyperwallet account.

1. Follow the directions in the email to start your Hyperwallet activation.
2. When you start, an **Account Profile** form will open for **Personal Information**. Some of the fields are already populated with your information, but you'll need to enter the rest. When asked for **Occupation**, select the description that's closest to what you actually do, or leave this field blank.
3. The next form is **Activate Account**. You will be asked to enter and confirm a password for your digital wallet. Pick two security questions and provide answers. This is for account access if you forget your password.
4. Read and check the legal agreements before clicking **Confirm**.
5. Specify how your money should be transferred to by clicking the **Add Transfer Method** button.
6. Follow the directions on the screen:

   - Change your country or region and currency type if it is not what you want.
   - Click a transfer method option to select it, then click **Continue**.
   - Provide any required information (it will vary based on transfer method), then click **Confirm**.

Your Hyperwallet is now set up, and you should receive an email that confirms this!
